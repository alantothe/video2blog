## Travel Diary

- **Purpose of titles:** Introduce a personal journey or reflective narrative that offers readers insight into a place through an individual’s experience. The title should entice readers with the uniqueness of the story.
    
- **Audience mindset:** Readers are looking for an engaging, authentic story that transports them to a destination through someone else’s eyes.
    
- **Title structure rules:**
    
    - Combine the destination with a narrative element or theme (e.g., “Tracing…,” “Following…,” “Discovering…”). Use a colon if it clarifies the narrative angle.
        
    - Use descriptive, active verbs to signal movement and reflection (“Journey,” “Exploring,” “Seeking”) rather than static nouns.
        
    - Highlight what makes the narrative unique – a quest, a personal connection, a challenge overcome.
        
    - Keep the title within 70–90 characters; ensure the main subject appears early.
        
    - Avoid starting with a verb; instead, include the storyteller or context (“My Solo Trek across…” or implied subject).
        
    - Limit to one punctuation mark (a colon or comma) to maintain simplicity and readability.
        
    - Capitalize only the first word and proper nouns.
        
- **Hook and angle strategy:**
    
    - Emphasize personal stakes or emotions (“Rediscovering My Heritage in…,” “Chasing Light in…”) to differentiate from generic destination pieces.
        
    - Indicate transformation or discovery to show progression (“From City to Wilderness,” “A Culinary Awakening in…”).
        
    - Incorporate time frames (“Four Days in…,” “A Year Among…”) when they structure the story.
        
    - Use sensory or thematic imagery sparingly to evoke mood without slipping into cliché.
        
    - Avoid overpromising; the title should reflect the depth and honesty of the narrative.
        
    - Consider first‑person perspective cues (“My,” “Our”) to build connection if appropriate.
        
    - Stay clear of list formats unless the diary is structured as numbered entries.
        
- **Style, tone, and formatting rules:**
    
    - Adopt an introspective, evocative tone; avoid commercial or salesy language.
        
    - Use present tense or historical present to create immediacy.
        
    - Avoid hyperbolic adjectives; instead, hint at emotions or experiences authentically.
        
    - Do not end with a period; question marks can be used if the article revolves around a question.
        
    - Keep language accessible; avoid insider jargon that might alienate readers.
        
- **Preferred words and phrases:**
    
    - “Journey” / “Voyage” / “Trek”
        
    - “Diary” / “Journal” / “Notes” (sparingly, if accurate)
        
    - “Exploring” / “Wandering” / “Following”
        
    - “Reflections” / “Memoir”
        
    - “Rediscovering” / “Revisiting”
        
    - “In Search of” / “Chasing”
        
    - “On the Road to…”
        
    - “A Week in…” / “Days in…”
        
    - “Personal” / “First‑Hand”
        
    - “Through [Place]”
        
    - “Along [Route/Trail]”
        
    - “Stories from” / “Tales of”
        
    - “Encountering”
        
    - “Discovering”
        
    - “An Insider’s View”
        
- **Words and patterns to avoid:**
    
    - Clichés like “Hidden Gem” or “Off the Beaten Path”.
        
    - Overused superlatives (“Most Beautiful,” “Best Ever”) unless substantiated.
        
    - Hyperbolic adjectives (“Stunning,” “Incredible,” “Awesome”).
        
    - Generic labels (“Travel Diary” by itself) without context.
        
    - Misused words such as “Mecca,” “Nestled,” “Perched,” “Bustling,” “Galore,” “Eatery”.
        
    - Clickbait hooks (“You Won’t Believe,” “This Will Change You”).
        
    - Second‑person imperatives (“You Must Read”) that break the narrative connection.
        
    - Unnecessary dates unless they structure the story (e.g., “Summer 2025”).
        
- **Final quality checklist:**
    
    - Does the title convey both destination and narrative theme?
        
    - Is the headline concise and under ~90 characters with a clear subject?
        
    - Have you used active verbs and avoided starting with a verb?
        
    - Does the title hint at personal transformation or insight without cliché?
        
    - Are the most important keywords front‑loaded for search and clarity?
        
    - Is the tone authentic and reflective rather than promotional?
        
    - Have you avoided overused adjectives and misused travel words?
        
    - Is the punctuation minimal and formatting consistent with downstyle?
        
    - Would the title intrigue readers who enjoy narrative travel writing?
