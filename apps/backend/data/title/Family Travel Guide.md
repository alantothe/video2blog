## Family Travel Guide

- **Purpose of titles**: Convey clear, practical value for parents planning trips with children; highlight destination and age‑appropriate activities in a concise, approachable way.
    
- **Audience mindset**: Parents and caregivers seeking reliable advice to make family travel fun, safe and stress‑free.
    
- **Title structure rules**:
    
    - Start with a strong subject (destination or theme) and an active phrase or number; avoid vague introductions.
        
    - Incorporate age group or family‑centric descriptors (e.g., “with teens,” “for toddlers”) to set expectations.
        
    - Use numerals for lists (e.g., “7 Kid‑Friendly Beaches in…”), which improve clarity and SEO.
        
    - Keep titles under 10–12 words; summarise the benefit in one concise sentence.
        
    - Use present tense and active voice; avoid forms of “to be”.
        
    - Front‑load primary keywords (destination, activity) for search visibility.
        
    - Remove filler articles (“the,” “and,” “is”) when they add no meaning.
        
- **Hook and angle strategy**:
    
    - Emphasise usefulness over hype; summarise what parents will learn or do.
        
    - Offer a specific promise or takeaway (“What to Pack for…” or “Avoiding Lines at…”) to solve common travel problems.
        
    - Use urgency sparingly (e.g., “before booking,” “this season”) to encourage timely action without veering into clickbait.
        
    - Highlight unique family‑friendly features (parks, museums, free activities) rather than generic attractions.
        
    - Include numbers or orderly lists to signal easy‑to‑digest guidance.
        
    - When appropriate, identify cost‑saving or hassle‑free angles (e.g., budget, safety, convenience).
        
    - Speak directly to parental concerns (crowd‑avoidance, kid‑approved dining, rest breaks) to demonstrate empathy.
        
- **Style, tone, and formatting rules**:
    
    - Warm, trustworthy and inclusive; avoid patronising or overly promotional language.
        
    - Maintain clear and direct phrasing; avoid puns or wordplay that could obscure meaning.
        
    - Use title case for proper nouns; capitalise the first word and any names or regions.
        
    - Avoid exclamation points and sensational punctuation; rely on strong wording instead.
        
    - Do not start titles with “How to” or “Everything you need” – lead with the topic and value.
        
    - Keep titles within 60–70 characters to ensure full display in search and social feeds.
        
    - Ensure the title accurately reflects the article’s content and matches any on‑site categorisation or series naming.
        
- **Preferred words and phrases**:
    
    - kid‑friendly, family‑friendly, parents, toddlers, teens, children
        
    - activities, tips, tricks, ideas, itineraries, plans, highlights
        
    - fun, safe, easy, budget‑friendly, stress‑free, accessible, affordable
        
    - explore, discover, enjoy, experience, make the most
        
    - weekend getaway, road trip, vacation, adventure, day trip
        
    - free, low‑cost, insider, must‑have, essentials
        
    - with kids, for families, with teens, with toddlers
        
    - guide, plan, checklist, roadmap, itinerary
        
- **Words and patterns to avoid**:
    
    - clichés such as **“hidden gem,” “bucket list,” “must‑see,” “off the beaten path,”** or **“friendly locals”**.
        
    - Hyperbolic adjectives like **“stunning,” “breathtaking,” “charming,” “quaint,”** or **“amazing”**.
        
    - Generic phrases like **“something for everyone,” “family‑run restaurant,”** or **“best ever.”**
        
    - Sensational clickbait patterns (“You won’t believe,” “Shocking tips”).
        
    - Vague nouns such as **“stuff,” “things,”** or **“places”** without qualifiers (replace with specific activities).
        
    - Overused marketing words like **“ultimate,” “definitive,” “epic,”** or **“life‑changing.”**
        
    - Redundant qualifiers (e.g., “very unique,” “truly authentic”).
        
    - Second‑person pronouns used as commands (“Take your kids to…”); imply benefit instead.
        
- **Final quality checklist**:
    
    - Does the title clearly state the destination and what families will gain?
        
    - Are age‑specific or family descriptors included?
        
    - Is the title under 12 words and free of filler words?
        
    - Are useful keywords (destination, activity) front‑loaded?
        
    - Does the wording avoid clichés and hyperbole?
        
    - Is the tone warm, practical and inclusive?
        
    - Does it offer a specific benefit or solution?
        
    - Is the verb active and present tense?
        
    - Does it avoid leading with “How to” or similar formulaic openings?
