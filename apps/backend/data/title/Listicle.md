## Listicle

- **Purpose of titles:** Promise a clear, organised list of items or ideas, tell readers how many to expect and why the list is relevant or valuable.
    
- **Audience mindset:** Readers look for digestible, scannable information that provides recommendations, rankings or tips; they often skim for the most relevant items.
    
- **Title structure rules:**
    
    - Start with a numeral representing the number of list items (digits are more eye‑catching and search‑friendly).
        
    - Follow with the subject and qualifier, stating what’s being listed and who it’s for (“10 Best Hikes for Beginners”).
        
    - Use concise language; keep titles within 8–12 words to ensure readability.
        
    - Include the primary keyword early for SEO and clarity.
        
    - Consider adding a time reference (e.g., year or season) when timeliness enhances relevance.
        
    - Avoid overcomplicated structures; the promise should be immediately clear (“Top 15 Eco‑Friendly Resorts 2026”).
        
    - Ensure the number in the title matches the actual list content; adjust as needed during final edits.
        
- **Hook and angle strategy:**
    
    - Use adjectives that convey authority or urgency (“Best,” “Essential,” “Must‑Try,” “Top,” “Ultimate”).
        
    - Highlight the benefit or problem solved (“5 Easy Meals for Busy Parents”).
        
    - Address a specific audience or niche where appropriate (“7 Tech Gadgets for Digital Nomads”).
        
    - Mention unique or surprising angles (“10 Underrated National Parks”).
        
    - Include the current year to signal freshness when the list is likely to change over time.
        
    - Avoid sensationalist or misleading hooks; the list should deliver what the title promises.
        
- **Style, tone and formatting rules:**
    
    - Maintain an upbeat, informative tone that matches the brand’s voice.
        
    - Use active voice and avoid passive constructions.
        
    - Capitalise consistently and avoid excessive punctuation.
        
    - Write numbers as digits to aid skimming and search indexing.
        
    - Keep wording simple and avoid jargon or acronyms unfamiliar to general readers.
        
    - Ensure the title remains reader‑focused and solves a problem or provides value.
        
- **Preferred words and phrases:**
    
    - “Top,” “Best,” “Must‑See,” “Essential,” “Reasons,” “Ways,” “Destinations,” “Ideas,” “Tips,” “Gifts,” “Guide,” “Checklist,” “For [Audience],” “Ranked,” “Budget‑Friendly,” “Easy,” “Quick,” “Fun,” “Creative,” “Surprising,” “Hidden Gems,” “Inspirational.”
        
- **Words and patterns to avoid:**
    
    - Generic adjectives like “great,” “awesome,” or “nice.”
        
    - Vague lists such as “Some” or “Various” without a clear number.
        
    - Clickbait (“You Won’t Believe These”), sensational language or unverified superlatives.
        
    - Puns or unclear metaphors that distract from the list’s purpose.
        
    - Numbers spelled out instead of digits (“Ten” rather than “10”).
        
    - Misleading rankings (e.g., calling something “best” without clear criteria).
        
    - Unnecessary filler phrases (“Things You Need to Know About”).
        
    - Titles longer than 60 characters that risk truncation.
        
- **Final quality checklist:**
    
    - Does the title accurately reflect the content and number of items?
        
    - Is the number written as a digit and positioned at the beginning?
        
    - Are the keywords and audience markers front‑loaded?
        
    - Is the title concise, scannable and free of jargon?
        
    - Does it promise real value or solutions without exaggeration?
        
    - Have you ensured alignment with SEO best practices (character count, relevant keywords)?
        
    - Does it avoid clickbait and overuse of superlatives?
        
    - Have you checked that the list actually contains the number of items advertised?
