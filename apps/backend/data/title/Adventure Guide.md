## Adventure Guide

- **Purpose of titles (1–2 lines)**
    
    - Inspire readers to explore and convey the essence of an adventurous experience while clearly signalling location, activity and unique appeal. Titles should be service‑oriented, promising practical guidance without exaggeration or clickbait.
        
    - Establish credibility and trust by accurately reflecting the content and avoiding over‑statement or misleading cause‑and‑effect claims.
        
- **Audience mindset (1 line)**
    
    - Readers are curious, thrill‑seeking travellers looking for authentic experiences and practical information on activities, logistics and safety.
        
- **Title structure rules (5–8 bullet points)**
    
    - Start with a dynamic verb or adjective (“Hiking,” “Discover,” “Breathtaking”) and immediately mention the destination or activity to ground the reader.
        
    - Include a clear subject (mountain, trail, island, region) and what makes it noteworthy, such as difficulty level, unique features or cultural context.
        
    - Keep titles concise (8–14 words) and in title case; capitalize only the first word and proper nouns.
        
    - Use active voice for immediacy and clarity.
        
    - Incorporate a differentiator (season, “off‑the‑beaten‑path,” “family‑friendly”) to signal the angle or audience, ensuring it reflects facts rather than hype.
        
    - Avoid unnecessary abbreviations; spell out lesser‑known acronyms and state names unless widely recognized.
        
    - Place important keywords toward the beginning for SEO, but do not sacrifice readability or accuracy.
        
- **Hook and angle strategy (5–8 bullet points)**
    
    - Highlight what’s unique or extraordinary about the experience (e.g., “glacier‑fed lakes,” “ancient ruins”) to spark curiosity while maintaining clarity.
        
    - Address reader pain points or aspirations—safety tips, accessibility, insider routes—so they see immediate value.
        
    - Evoke sensory details or emotional payoffs (“sunrise summit,” “forbidden jungle trek”) without resorting to clichés or exaggerations.
        
    - Where appropriate, use numbers to organize expectations (“5 Epic Kayaking Routes in the Pacific Northwest”) while ensuring the article delivers the promised count.
        
    - Avoid clickbait phrasing; set realistic expectations that match the article’s content to build trust.
        
    - When the guide involves potential risk, be transparent about difficulty and safety considerations; avoid glamorizing danger or implying guaranteed outcomes.
        
- **Style, tone and formatting rules (5–8 bullet points)**
    
    - Use an authoritative yet inviting tone—adventurous but grounded in expertise.
        
    - Follow AP style: prioritize consistency, clarity, accuracy and brevity.
        
    - Steer clear of hyperbolic adjectives (e.g., “mind‑blowing”) and vague intensifiers (“really,” “very”).
        
    - Ensure factual accuracy: if the headline references a causal relationship (“Wildfire Recovery: How Rain Rebuilt Yosemite”), verify that the story supports it.
        
    - Avoid stereotyping or cultural appropriation; respect local communities and their perspectives.
        
    - Keep punctuation simple; avoid exclamation points and unnecessary colons; use commas and dashes per AP style.
        
    - Write multiple headline options and test them with editors or analytics tools when possible.
        
- **Preferred words and phrases (8–15 bullet points)**
    
    - “Hiking,” “Trekking,” “Road‑tripping,” “Cycling”
        
    - “Hidden gem,” “Scenic,” “Breathtaking,” “Unspoiled”
        
    - “Ultimate,” “Complete Guide,” “Essential,” “Expert Tips”
        
    - “Family‑friendly,” “Pet‑friendly,” “Solo‑traveller”
        
    - “Off‑the‑beaten‑path,” “Remote,” “Wild,” “Rugged”
        
    - “Wildlife‑rich,” “Cultural insight,” “Historic,” “Architectural wonder”
        
    - “Budget‑friendly” (when appropriate)
        
    - Seasonal markers: “Summer,” “Winter,” “Monsoon,” “Spring Blossoms”
        
    - Numeric indicators: “Top 7,” “5 Must‑Do Trails,” “9 Epic Routes”
        
    - Location modifiers: “Pacific Northwest,” “Andes,” “Highlands,” “Desert”
        
- **Words and patterns to avoid (8–15 bullet points)**
    
    - Clickbait phrases (“secret,” “you won’t believe,” “shocking”).
        
    - Clichés such as “paradise,” “once‑in‑a‑lifetime” and “bucket list”—they have lost impact.
        
    - Over‑promises (e.g., “the only guide you’ll ever need”) that cannot be fulfilled.
        
    - Misleading implications of danger or safety (“Risk‑free climbing on Everest”).
        
    - Stereotypical descriptions of cultures or populations.
        
    - Generic terms like “beautiful place,” “great view” without specifics.
        
    - Excessive capitalization or all caps.
        
    - Titles that bury the main topic at the end or hide the destination.
        
    - Unnecessary jargon or abbreviations; avoid “NP” for National Park unless widely known.
        
- **Final quality checklist (6–10 bullet points)**
    
    - Does the title accurately reflect the article content and avoid exaggeration?
        
    - Are the most important keywords and location details placed early for readability and SEO?
        
    - Does the headline follow AP style in capitalization, punctuation and use of abbreviations?
        
    - Is the language active, clear and free of clichés?
        
    - Does the title convey the level of difficulty or risk honestly?
        
    - Have multiple options been reviewed with editors and stakeholders, considering audience and channel?
        
    - For guides with affiliated products (gear recommendations), is any material connection disclosed in the article (not necessarily in the headline) per FTC guidelines?.
        
    - If using numbers or superlatives, does the article deliver the promised content?.
