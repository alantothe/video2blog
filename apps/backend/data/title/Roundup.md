## Roundup

### Purpose of titles

Roundup titles should signal that the article compiles multiple stories, events, or items around a common theme, offering a concise catch‑up for readers.

### Audience mindset

Readers are looking for a quick overview of current news, trends or opportunities and expect the content to be timely and easily digestible.

### Title structure rules

- Begin with a number or time marker (e.g., “5 stories you missed this week”) to clarify scope.
    
- Clearly state the subject or theme of the roundup (travel deals, food trends, news stories, etc.).
    
- Specify the time frame when relevant (e.g., “January 2026,” “This week”).
    
- Use strong descriptors (“top,” “notable,” “essential”) to communicate why the items matter.
    
- Keep the headline concise and scannable (≈11 words/65 characters).
    
- Separate clauses with a colon or dash if needed; avoid clutter.
    
- Ensure the title is meaningful on its own without the article’s context.
    
- Use present tense and active voice; omit filler articles.
    

### Hook and angle strategy

- Emphasise timeliness or exclusivity to create urgency (“This week’s can’t‑miss travel news”).
    
- Highlight the benefit: convenience, curation, staying informed.
    
- Use numbers to structure and draw readers in.
    
- Mention a key trend or unexpected element to generate curiosity.
    
- Avoid sensationalism; fulfil the promise in the content.
    
- Leverage ethical FOMO by suggesting that readers might miss important information.
    
- Spotlight unique or standout items included in the roundup.
    
- Tailor the angle to the audience’s interests (foodies, budget travellers, culture enthusiasts, etc.).
    

### Style, tone, and formatting rules

- Maintain a balanced, neutral tone that upholds editorial credibility.
    
- Use crisp, energetic language to convey momentum and relevance.
    
- Apply title‑case and minimal punctuation; a colon or dash is sufficient.
    
- Represent numbers as numerals.
    
- Avoid rhetorical questions; state the news clearly.
    
- Steer clear of hyperbole; stay factual and measured.
    
- Use inclusive, accessible language.
    
- Keep consistency in voice across recurring roundups.

### Words and patterns to avoid

- Overused travel clichés (hidden gem, breathtaking, must‑see).
    
- Sensational phrases (“will blow your mind,” “you won’t believe”) that mislead.
    
- Vague terms like “various,” “miscellaneous” or “stuff.”
    
- Unspecific time markers (“recently,” “not long ago”) without clarity.
    
- Repetition of adjectives (e.g., “new new deals”).
    
- Negative or fear‑based language.
    
- Misleading counts (claiming more items than provided).
    
- Heavy jargon or obscure acronyms.
    
- Excessive punctuation, exclamation marks or emojis.
    
- Promising exhaustive coverage (“everything you need to know”) without delivering.
    

### Final quality checklist

- Does it specify the number of items or the time frame?
    
- Is the language neutral and trustworthy?
    
- Is it concise and includes numerals where appropriate?
    
- Does it deliver on its promise without overstatement or clickbait?
    
- Is it free from clichés and sensational language?
    
- Does it match the content’s scope accurately?
    
- Does it align with the publication’s tone and voice?
