## Food Travel Guide

- **Purpose of titles**: Help travellers explore a destination through its culinary offerings by spotlighting distinctive dishes, markets, restaurants and eating experiences.
    
- **Audience mindset**: Food enthusiasts and travellers wanting authentic tastes and insider culinary tips; they seek sensory inspiration and practical dining advice.
    
- **Title structure rules**:
    
    - Start with a sensory or action verb (“Savor,” “Taste,” “Sample,” “Sip”) followed by the cuisine or dishes and destination.
        
    - Specify the location and type of food experience (e.g., street food, markets, traditional breakfast) up front for clarity and SEO.
        
    - Use numbers when highlighting lists of eateries or dishes; avoid combining a number with a trigger word like “why” or “how”.
        
    - Keep titles concise (10–12 words) and descriptive; summarise the promise in one sentence.
        
    - Use present tense and avoid gerunds (no “eating” or “discovering”); choose active voice.
        
    - Omit articles and filler words to tighten the title.
        
    - Use title case and proper nouns; include widely known regional names or dish names when they add specificity.
        
- **Hook and angle strategy**:
    
    - Highlight authenticity and uniqueness rather than touristy hype; focus on local flavours and cultural context.
        
    - Use power words like **“Discover,” “Unveil,”** or **“Journey through”** to evoke curiosity without exaggeration.
        
    - Promise value—what readers will taste or learn (“where to eat like a local,” “must‑try street snacks”).
        
    - Leverage specificity (e.g., “Sichuan chili hot pot,” “Basque pintxos trail”) to stand out and support SEO.
        
    - Address common traveller questions (budget dining, vegetarian options, family‑friendly restaurants).
        
    - Avoid overused triggers; choose either a number or a question phrase but not both.
        
    - Emphasise personal experience or insider access only when genuine; avoid implying secrets or exclusivity if the places are well known.
        
- **Style, tone, and formatting rules**:
    
    - Descriptive yet factual; evoke flavours and textures without using overblown adjectives (no “mouth‑watering” or “to die for”).
        
    - Maintain respect for the culture being covered; avoid appropriation or stereotyping.
        
    - Use inclusive language; consider dietary diversity (vegetarian, vegan, halal) when relevant.
        
    - Keep titles straightforward; avoid puns or wordplay that may confuse search algorithms.
        
    - Use plural nouns when discussing multiple dishes or venues (“5 street foods”).
        
    - Refrain from superlatives (“best,” “ultimate”) unless factually supported and explained in the article.
        
    - Ensure the title matches the article’s actual content to build trust.

    - **“Hidden gem,” “secret spot,” “off the beaten path”** and similar clichés.
        
    - Hyperbolic or vague descriptors (**“mouth‑watering,” “to die for,” “foodie paradise,” “bursting with flavor”**).
        
    - Misused words like **“boast,” “nestled,” “perched,” “jam‑packed”**.
        
    - Overpromised superlatives (**“best,” “ultimate,” “definitive”**) without factual backing.
        
    - Generic nouns (**“things,” “stuff”**) instead of specific dishes or experiences.
        
    - “You won’t believe” or other clickbait formulas.
        
    - Stereotypical phrases (**“exotic flavors,” “friendly locals”**) that oversimplify culture.
        
    - Combining a trigger word and a number (e.g., “Why 10 Foods…”).
        
- **Final quality checklist**:
    
    - Does the title clearly describe the food focus and destination?
        
    - Are sensory verbs used to evoke interest without exaggeration?
        
    - Does it avoid clichés and misused words like “hidden gem” or “mouth‑watering”?
        
    - Are active verbs and present tense employed?
        
    - Is the title concise (<12 words) and free of filler?
        
    - Does it choose either a number or a question/trigger word but not both?
        
    - Are keywords front‑loaded and culturally respectful?
        
    - Does the title accurately reflect the content and avoid overstating exclusivity?
        
    - Is the tone informative and inclusive rather than sensational?
