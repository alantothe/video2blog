## Beginner’s Guide

- **Purpose of titles (1–2 lines)**
    
    - Reassure novices that the article offers clear, step‑by‑step information and demystifies a topic they may find intimidating.
        
    - Signal that the content is foundational and avoids jargon, while being thorough and reliable.
        
- **Audience mindset (1 line)**
    
    - Readers are likely uncertain, eager to learn, and seeking trusted guidance that simplifies complex topics without dumbing them down.
        
- **Title structure rules (5–8 bullet points)**
    
    - Begin with “Beginner’s Guide to…,” “How to…,” “Step‑by‑Step Guide,” or similar format to set expectations.
        
    - Specify the subject (skill, dish, destination, concept) and, where useful, the context or scope (“for First‑Time Backpackers,” “to French Wines”).
        
    - Keep the headline straightforward and free of puns; clarity takes precedence over cleverness.
        
    - Use active verbs and concise phrasing; avoid leading with modifiers that delay the subject.
        
    - Limit length to about 8–12 words to maintain readability.
        
    - Include a key benefit (“…Without Stress,” “…That Saves Money”) only if the article truly provides that benefit.
        
    - Follow title‑case capitalization and avoid abbreviations unless widely known.
        
    - Ensure the main keyword (topic) appears near the front for SEO.
        
- **Hook and angle strategy (5–8 bullet points)**
    
    - Empathize with the novice’s challenges; include phrases like “First‑Time,” “No Experience Needed,” or “From Scratch” to highlight accessibility.
        
    - Promise specific outcomes (e.g., “Bake Perfect Sourdough,” “Plan Your First Camping Trip”) without overhyping results.
        
    - Use numbers to break down complex processes (“7 Steps to Start Investing”) when the article includes discrete steps.
        
    - Highlight time savings or simplified learning curves (“In One Weekend,” “Under 2 Hours”) only when accurate and not misleading.
        
    - Avoid jargon or technical language that might alienate beginners; translate concepts into plain language.
        
    - Reinforce trust by referencing expertise, such as “by [Chef/Expert Name]” or “Expert‑Reviewed,” when permissible and true.
        
    - Stay honest: do not promise mastery if the article covers only basics.
        
    - Offer reassurance about common fears (“…Without Breaking the Bank,” “…Without Fear of Failure”).
        
- **Style, tone and formatting rules (5–8 bullet points)**
    
    - Maintain a supportive, instructive tone; avoid condescension or inside jokes.
        
    - Prioritize clarity and brevity; eliminate filler words and ambiguous descriptors.
        
    - Adhere to AP style guidelines for capitalization, numerals and abbreviations.
        
    - Use second‑person voice sparingly; focus on what readers will learn rather than what “you must do.”
        
    - Avoid sensational claims or fear‑based hooks; build credibility through accurate information and balanced language.
        
    - Do not use ellipses (…) or multiple punctuation marks.
        
    - Emphasize accessibility; signal that the piece is inclusive of beginners from diverse backgrounds.
        
    - Test multiple versions to optimise for different channels (search vs. social).
        
- **Preferred words and phrases (8–15 bullet points)**
    
    - “Beginner’s Guide,” “How to,” “Step‑by‑Step,” “First‑Time”
        
    - “Essential,” “Basics,” “Simple,” “From Scratch,” “Foundations”
        
    - “Tutorial,” “Introduction,” “Explained,” “Made Easy”
        
    - “Fundamentals,” “Getting Started,” “In Plain English”
        
    - “No Experience Needed,” “For Beginners,” “Simplified”
        
    - “What You Need to Know,” “Start Here”
        
    - “Mistakes to Avoid” (if the article covers common pitfalls)
        
    - “Checklist,” “Toolkit”
        
    - “Quick Start,” “Start Today”
        
    - “Step‑by‑Step Instructions”
        
- **Words and patterns to avoid (8–15 bullet points)**
    
    - Over‑promising mastery or expertise (“Master Investing Overnight”).
        
    - Vague descriptors like “amazing,” “incredible,” or “ultimate” when aimed at novices; these can intimidate rather than attract.
        
    - Slang, insider jargon or abbreviations that novices may not understand.
        
    - Clickbait phrases (“hack,” “secret trick”) that imply shortcuts or results without effort.
        
    - Fear‑mongering language (“Don’t Ruin Your…”) that plays on anxiety.
        
    - Sarcasm or humor that might undermine clarity.
        
    - All caps or excessive punctuation.
        
    - Hidden keywords or stuffing; keep SEO natural and reader‑first.
        
    - Titles that bury the main topic at the end of the line.
        
- **Final quality checklist (6–10 bullet points)**
    
    - Does the title clearly signal that it is for beginners and state the subject?
        
    - Are promised outcomes accurate and achievable within the article?
        
    - Have jargon and abbreviations been minimized?
        
    - Does the headline follow AP style (title case, punctuation) and active voice?
        
    - Are keywords placed early without diminishing readability?
        
    - Has the wording been checked for cultural sensitivity and inclusivity?
        
    - Is the tone inviting and supportive, not patronizing or alarmist?
        
    - Have you tested alternate versions and solicited feedback?
