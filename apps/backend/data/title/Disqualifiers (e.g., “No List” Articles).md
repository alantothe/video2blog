## Disqualifiers (e.g., “No List” Articles)

- **Purpose of titles:** Alert readers to destinations or experiences facing overtourism, environmental degradation or ethical issues, encouraging responsible travel decisions. The goal is to inform and advocate without sensationalising or calling for outright boycotts.
    
- **Audience mindset:** Travellers who care about sustainability and ethical considerations and want to be informed about places under strain.
    
- **Title structure rules:**
    
    - Clearly identify the destination or practice being scrutinised; avoid vague references.
        
    - Use cautionary phrases like “Think Twice Before Visiting,” “Why [Place] Is Under Pressure,” or “Overtourism Warning.”
        
    - Where appropriate, pair the destination with the underlying issue (“Venice Overtourism: Why Crowds Are Straining the City”).
        
    - Keep titles factual; avoid sensational adjectives that imply doom or disgust.
        
    - If referencing a list of locations, indicate the purpose (“5 Destinations to Skip in 2026 for Sustainable Travel”).
        
    - Limit the title to ~60–70 characters; longer explanations can go in the sub‑headline.
        
    - Use title case and avoid abbreviations or slang.
        
    - Do not use imperative commands like “Boycott [Place]”—the goal is awareness, not prohibition.
        
- **Hook and angle strategy:**
    
    - Emphasise the underlying reasons: environmental damage, cultural erosion, overcrowding, or ethical conflicts.
        
    - Highlight the human and ecological impacts to evoke empathy rather than outrage.
        
    - Where possible, offer constructive alternatives or solutions (“How to Visit Responsibly,” “Off‑Peak Alternatives”).
        
    - Use data or authoritative sources within the article to support claims; the title should reflect this grounding in fact.
        
    - Draw connections to broader themes like climate change, local livelihoods or UNESCO warnings.
        
    - Avoid pitting travellers against locals; frame issues within systemic pressures and global tourism trends.
        
    - Present the idea as part of a larger ethical conversation rather than an isolated scandal.
        
- **Style, tone and formatting rules:**
    
    - Adopt a respectful, measured tone; avoid shaming or guilt‑tripping readers.
        
    - Use present tense and plain language; avoid loaded or dramatic phrasing.
        
    - Ensure transparency: if the article includes opinion or advocacy, signal it clearly (e.g., “Opinion” tag) rather than disguising it as pure news.
        
    - Respect local communities by accurately representing their perspectives and concerns.
        
    - Steer clear of clickbait or fear‑mongering; do not exaggerate dangers or degrade the destination’s reputation.
        
    - Avoid clichés like “Paradise lost” or “Tourist trap hell” that oversimplify complex issues.
        
    - Uphold editorial integrity by consulting subject matter experts and fact‑checking environmental claims.
        
- **Preferred words and phrases:**
    
    - “Overtourism,” “Sustainable travel,” “Environmental impact,” “Cultural preservation,” “Think twice before visiting,” “Under pressure,” “Responsible travel,” “Crowd‑free alternatives,” “Visitor limits,” “Ethical concerns,” “Local voices,” “Conservation,” “Seasonal crowding,” “Long‑term sustainability,” “Protecting heritage.”
        
- **Words and patterns to avoid:**
    
    - Alarmist terms (“Disaster,” “Ruined forever,” “Destroyed by tourists”) unless factually supported and contextualised.
        
    - Absolutes (“Never go,” “Ban tourism”) that overstate the article’s stance.
        
    - Sensational hooks (“Shocking truth,” “Hidden scandal”) designed purely for clicks.
        
    - Personal attacks or inflammatory language toward travellers or locals.
        
    - Over‑promised solutions (“Easy fix,” “Quick way to solve overtourism”).
        
    - Humour or sarcasm that could trivialise serious issues.
        
    - Stigmatising descriptors (“Victim city,” “Tourist hellhole”).
        
- **Final quality checklist:**
    
    - Does the title accurately convey the focus on overtourism or ethical concerns without sensationalising?
        
    - Is the destination or issue clearly identified and contextualised?
        
    - Are cautionary or advisory terms used judiciously (e.g., “think twice”)?
        
    - Is the tone respectful toward both locals and travellers?
        
    - Have you avoided alarmist or absolute language that implies prohibition or doom?
        
    - Are any claims in the title supported by verified facts within the article?
        
    - Is the title within 60–70 characters and easily scannable?
        
    - Does the title uphold editorial standards of honesty, accuracy and integrity?
