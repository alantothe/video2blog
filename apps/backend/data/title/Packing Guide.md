## Packing Guide

- **Purpose of titles (1–2 lines)**
    
    Titles for packing guides should make it clear that the article delivers practical checklists or instructions tailored to a destination or occasion. They promise completeness and ease for readers preparing for a trip.
    
- **Audience mindset (1 line)**
    
    Readers are planning a trip and want a reliable, easy‑to‑follow list of what to bring; they seek convenience and assurance that nothing essential will be forgotten.
    
- **Title structure rules (5–8 bullet points)**
    
    - Include “packing list,” “packing guide,” “what to pack” or similar phrase so the intent is obvious.
        
    - Specify the destination, season or type of trip (e.g., “for Europe in winter” or “for a weekend camping trip”).
        
    - Use numbers or qualifiers such as “10 essentials” to signal a clear, digestible list.
        
    - Employ “how to” or “guide” formulations for instructional appeal.
        
    - Use parentheses or brackets to add clarifying details or benefits (e.g., “carry‑on only,” “weather‑proof gear”).
        
    - Keep the title concise (under 12–15 words) and make sure it stands alone.
        
    - Use sentence case; capitalize only the first word and proper nouns.
        
    - Avoid articles and forms of “to be” to keep the headline tight.
        
- **Hook and angle strategy (5–8 bullet points)**
    
    - Emphasize the benefit of being prepared (“essential items,” “save space,” “no stress”).
        
    - Use “ultimate,” “complete,” or “essential” judiciously to convey thoroughness without exaggeration.
        
    - Tie the guide to a timely trend or season (“summer 2026,” “winter holidays”).
        
    - Highlight unique aspects of the trip (e.g., “lightweight gear for backpackers” or “family‑friendly packing”).
        
    - Incorporate numbers to set expectations (“15 must‑pack items”).
        
    - Use questions sparingly; instead, focus on clear statements (“what to pack for…”).
        
    - Mention time‑saving or space‑saving techniques for added appeal.
        
    - Consider including a targeted audience (“for first‑time travelers,” “for business trips”).
        
- **Style, tone, and formatting rules (5–8 bullet points)**
    
    - Use a friendly, helpful tone that reassures readers.
        
    - Maintain sentence case and simple language for quick scanning.
        
    - Avoid clickbait and over‑the‑top adjectives.
        
    - Include keywords that align with the destination and type of guide for SEO.
        
    - Keep verbs active (“pack,” “bring,” “gear up”).
        
    - Ensure inclusivity (e.g., family, solo travelers) without assumptions about gender or ability.
        
    - Avoid jargon; describe items in plain terms.
        
    - Use parentheses or brackets to clarify specifics (e.g., “(+ downloadable checklist)”).
        
- **Preferred words and phrases (8–15 bullet points)**
    
    - “Packing list”
        
    - “Packing guide”
        
    - “What to pack”

- **Words and patterns to avoid (8–15 bullet points)**
    
    - Vague titles (“Packing list”) without specifying destination or context.
        
    - Sensational phrases (“You won’t believe,” “Insane gear”).
        
    - Negative or fear‑mongering words (“Don’t make these mistakes”).
        
    - Overused buzzwords (“hack,” “epic”) unless justified.
        
    - Acronyms or slang unfamiliar to general readers.
        
    - Excessive superlatives (“best ever,” “perfect”) that overpromise.
        
    - Ambiguous pronouns or unclear references (“Everything you need”).
        
    - Questions that could be statements (“What to pack for…” works better as “What to pack for…”).
        
    - Terms unrelated to packing (e.g., “review,” “analysis”).
        
    - Redundant phrases (“packing list list”).
        
- **Final quality checklist (6–10 bullet points)**
    
    - Does the title clearly indicate that the article is a packing guide or list?
        
    - Have you specified the destination, season or trip type to orient the reader?
        
    - Is the headline concise and free of articles and unnecessary verbs?
        
    - Does it use sentence case and capitalize proper nouns correctly?
        
    - Are benefits or unique angles (e.g., travel light, complete essentials) highlighted?
        
    - Have you avoided clickbait and sensational language?
        
    - Does the title stand alone and answer “what is this about and why should I read it?”?
        
    - Are keywords included for SEO without sacrificing clarity?
        
    - Has inclusive language been used (no gendered assumptions)?
