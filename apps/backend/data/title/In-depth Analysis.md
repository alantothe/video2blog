## In-depth Analysis

- **Purpose of titles:** Signal a deep, research‑based examination of a subject and convey why the analysis matters. The title should promise insights, not just facts, and indicate what aspect is being investigated.
    
- **Audience mindset:** Readers expect to gain a thorough understanding and nuanced context from an authoritative source; they are willing to invest time in long‑form content.
    
- **Title structure rules:**
    
    - Use a strong subject and active verb; avoid “label heads” that lack verbs.
        
    - Lead with the primary keyword or topic to aid search visibility and reader comprehension.
        
    - Clearly state the subject and the analytical angle; a colon or dash can separate the main topic from the specific focus (e.g., “Climate Policy: Assessing the Impact on Urban Economies”).
        
    - Keep titles concise—ideally within 50–60 characters but long enough to be specific.
        
    - Use present tense and active voice for relevance and immediacy.
        
    - Include timeframes or quantitative descriptors when relevant (“2025 Data Trends in Renewable Energy”).
        
    - Ensure the title can stand alone and fairly represent the article.
        
- **Hook and angle strategy:**
    
    - Highlight surprising findings, new interpretations, or trends that make the analysis newsworthy.
        
    - Emphasise cause‑and‑effect or “why/how” angles (“Why Remote Work Is Reshaping Suburbs”).
        
    - Use numbers or percentages to quantify the insight (“5 Key Drivers of Inflation Explained”).
        
    - Incorporate topical keywords and emerging terms early for SEO alignment.
        
    - Avoid sensationalism; the hook should come from the significance of the analysis, not clickbait.
        
    - Promise actionable implications or solutions where appropriate (“What These Findings Mean for Investors”).
        
- **Style, tone and formatting rules:**
    
    - Maintain an authoritative and serious tone that treats the subject with respect.
        
    - Use plain language; avoid jargon and unfamiliar acronyms unless necessary and explained.
        
    - Avoid puns or “clever” wordplay that obscures meaning.
        
    - Be honest and accurate—no clickbait or overpromising.
        
    - Capitalise according to publication style (e.g., sentence case or title case) and be consistent.
        
    - If using a subtitle, ensure it adds clarity rather than repeating information.
        
- **Preferred words and phrases:**
    
    - Analysis, Insight, “Behind the Numbers,” “What [X] Means,” “Unpacked,” “Explained,” “In Focus,” “Inside,” “A Deep Dive into,” “Lessons from,” “Trends in,” “Impact of,” “Driving Forces,” “The Future of.”
        
- **Words and patterns to avoid:**
    
    - Clickbait terms like “shocking,” “mind‑blowing,” or “you won’t believe.”
        
    - Vague descriptors (“interesting,” “various”), generic terms (“thing,” “stuff”).
        
    - Puns, jokes or sarcasm that detract from seriousness.
        
    - Overly technical jargon or unexplained acronyms.
        
    - Names of individuals not widely recognised; focus on the subject matter instead.
        
    - Excessive adjectives or embellishments that make the title too long.
        
    - Rhetorical questions that confuse rather than clarify.
        
- **Final quality checklist:**
    
    - Does the title accurately reflect the article’s central analysis and scope?
        
    - Is there a clear subject and strong verb?
        
    - Are the main keywords or topic front‑loaded for SEO and clarity?
        
    - Is the title within 50–60 characters and free of jargon or acronyms?
        
    - Does it avoid clickbait, puns and overpromising?
        
    - Will the title stand alone on social or search platforms, giving readers enough context to decide whether to read on?
        
    - Have you proofread for spelling, grammar and style consistency?
        
    - If adding a subtitle, does it genuinely enhance comprehension?
