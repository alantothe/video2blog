## Cost Breakdown

- **Purpose of titles:** Answer the reader’s question about how much a product or service costs and set expectations that the article will provide a transparent breakdown of pricing factors.
    
- **Audience mindset:** Readers are evaluating a purchase and want honest, detailed cost information to make an informed decision.
    
- **Title structure rules:**
    
    - Mirror the core cost question people type into search engines (“How Much Does [X] Cost?”).
        
    - Keep the title under about 70 characters so it isn’t truncated on search results.
        
    - Start with the exact query, then use a colon or dash to add context (“Factors, Considerations & Examples”).
        
    - Use clear, descriptive language: include the product/service name and, if relevant, a year or location to signal freshness.
        
    - Avoid fluff; every word should contribute to answering the question.
        
    - Maintain sentence case or title case consistently with editorial guidelines.
        
    - Consider SEO by incorporating relevant keywords naturally (e.g., “pricing,” “cost breakdown”).
        
    - If the subject has multiple pricing models, mention this in the secondary phrase (“plans,” “tiers,” “ranges”).
        
- **Hook and angle strategy:**
    
    - Emphasize transparency and trust (“honest,” “true cost,” “what you need to know”).
        
    - Suggest that the article provides more than a number by mentioning factors and examples.
        
    - Include a time marker (“in 2026,” “this year”) when prices change frequently to convey timeliness.
        
    - Allude to cost‑saving insights or value comparisons without being salesy.
        
    - Mirror searcher intent to improve click‑through rates; many searches start with “How much does …”.
        
    - Avoid sensational or deceptive hooks; focus on clarity and usefulness.
        
    - Consider localizing the title if costs vary significantly by region (e.g., “in New York”).
        
- **Style, tone, and formatting rules:**
    
    - Neutral, factual, and educational; resist promotional language.
        
    - Use plain language; avoid technical jargon unless it is defined in the article.
        
    - Maintain a confident yet approachable tone; signal that the reader will get a straight answer.
        
    - Keep punctuation minimal; use one question mark if the title is phrased as a question.
        
    - Consistent capitalization according to the publication’s style.
        
    - Avoid unnecessary adjectives; let the facts speak for themselves.
        
- **Preferred words and phrases:**
    
    - “How much,” “cost,” “price,” “pricing”
        
    - “Cost of,” “What does [X] cost,” “Price range”
        
    - “Breakdown,” “Factors,” “Considerations,” “Examples”
        
    - “Average,” “Typical,” “Per month,” “Per person,” “Starting at”
        
    - “2026,” “This year,” “in [City/Region]”
        
    - “What you need to know,” “Guide to,” “Cost guide”
        
    - “Transparent,” “Detailed,” “Comprehensive”
        
    - “Range,” “Low to high,” “Upfront”
        
- **Words and patterns to avoid:**
    
    - Misleading adjectives (“cheap,” “bargain,” “rock‑bottom”) unless substantiated
        
    - Salesy or clickbait phrases (“unbelievable deal,” “shocking prices”)
        
    - Vague statements (“affordable,” “expensive”) without context
        
    - Jargon or acronyms not explained to general readers
        
    - Negative phrases like “hidden fees” unless the article explicitly covers them
        
    - Overly long titles crammed with multiple keywords or questions
        
    - All caps or exclamation marks that cheapen credibility
        
    - Superlatives (“lowest,” “highest”) unless supported by data
        
- **Final quality checklist:**
    
    - Does the title mirror the exact cost question searchers ask (“How much does X cost?”)?
        
    - Is the title under 70 characters and free of unnecessary filler?
        
    - Have you added a succinct secondary phrase to preview the article’s scope (factors, examples)?
        
    - Does the title include relevant details like year or location if they influence cost?
        
    - Is the language neutral, transparent, and devoid of salesy terms?
        
    - Have you checked that the title aligns with search intent and includes keywords naturally?
        
    - Are punctuation and capitalization consistent with house style?
        
    - Does the title set clear expectations about the depth and scope of the cost breakdown?
        
    - Would a reader trust the article’s transparency based on the title alone?
