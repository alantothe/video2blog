## Review

### Purpose of titles

Review titles must identify the subject being evaluated and set the expectation that readers will receive a balanced assessment. They should entice readers seeking an informed opinion without resorting to hyperbole.

### Audience mindset

Readers want a trustworthy evaluation to help decide whether a product, service or experience meets their needs.

### Title structure rules

- Begin with the name of the product, service or destination under review to ensure clarity and SEO.
    
- Include a concise evaluative tag or descriptor (e.g., “review,” “hands‑on look,” “worth it?”) to signal that the article assesses the subject.
    
- Integrate a key takeaway or angle that hints at the verdict without overselling.
    
- Keep the title around 11 words or 65 characters for optimal visibility.
    
- Use active voice and present tense; avoid filler articles.
    
- Note the year or version when relevant (e.g., “2026” or “v2.0”) to indicate timeliness.
    
- Employ strong, descriptive verbs or adjectives (e.g., “delivers,” “disappoints,” “surprises”) while maintaining neutrality.
    
- Ensure the title stands alone; avoid inside jokes or references that may confuse readers.
    

### Hook and angle strategy

- Focus on the central question or value proposition (e.g., “Is it worth the price?”).
    
- Emphasise the insights readers will gain (performance, comfort, taste, value for money).
    
- Highlight unique features or differentiators to pique curiosity.
    
- Pose a direct question the article answers, encouraging clicks while avoiding misdirection.
    
- Avoid exaggerated claims; clarity and honesty foster trust.
    
- Mention comparisons or alternatives when relevant to contextualise the review.
    
- Incorporate searchable keywords (brand, model, category) to aid discovery.
    
- Anchor statements in factual observations rather than hype.
    

### Style, tone, and formatting rules

- Adopt an objective, balanced and authoritative tone; disclose any affiliations.
    
- Use plain language and get to the point quickly.
    
- Avoid sensational adjectives; focus on specific, measurable attributes.
    
- Follow title‑case or sentence‑case per publication style; limit punctuation.
    
- Use numerals for metrics, ratings and versions.
    
- Avoid unexplained jargon; explain technical terms in plain language.
    
- Ensure transparency about sponsorships or partnerships.
    
- Maintain consistency with the broader editorial voice.

### Words and patterns to avoid

- Travel clichés such as “hidden gem,” “must‑see” or “breathtaking,” which are irrelevant in reviews.
    
- Sensational claims like “will change your life” or “mind‑blowing” unless substantiated.
    
- Clickbait phrases (“you won’t believe,” “shocking truth”) that erode credibility.
    
- Overly emotional or extreme language that undermines neutrality.
    
- Unexplained industry jargon or acronyms.
    
- Negative hyperbole (e.g., “worst ever”) without evidence.
    
- Redundant descriptors like “a detailed review” (the term “review” already implies depth).
    
- Ambiguous adjectives such as “nice” or “different.”
    
- Unsubstantiated claims (e.g., “guaranteed results,” “perfect for everyone”).
    
- Passive voice or past‑tense phrasing.
