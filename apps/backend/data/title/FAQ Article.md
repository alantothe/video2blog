## FAQ Article

- **Purpose of titles:** Tell readers that the piece provides answers to frequently asked questions about a specific topic, product or destination. Titles should convey comprehensiveness and reliability.
    
- **Audience mindset:** Users are seeking quick, trustworthy answers to common questions. They may be prospective customers, travellers or readers with limited time.
    
- **Title structure rules:**
    
    - Include the term “FAQ” or spell out “Frequently Asked Questions” to signal the format.
        
    - Pair the format indicator with the subject matter (e.g., “Electric Vehicles FAQ,” “Frequently Asked Questions About [Destination]”).
        
    - Where appropriate, add a descriptor like “Guide,” “Everything You Need to Know,” or “Complete Answer Guide.”
        
    - When the article addresses a specific number of questions, include that number only if it is meaningful (“Top 10 FAQs About…”). Avoid arbitrarily adding numbers to fabricate curiosity.
        
    - Keep titles concise and scannable (~60–65 characters); avoid overcrowding with keywords.
        
    - Use capitalisation consistently and avoid unnecessary punctuation.
        
    - Do not phrase the entire headline as a question; the FAQ format already implies Q&A.
        
    - Specify version or update year only when the content changes materially (“FAQ 2026 Update”).
        
- **Hook and angle strategy:**
    
    - Emphasise completeness and clarity (“All Your Questions Answered,” “What to Know About…”).
        
    - Highlight the pain points or interests driving queries (“Visa Requirements,” “Shipping Costs,” “Safety”).
        
    - Signal expertise or authority (“Expert Answers,” “Official Guide”) when accurate.
        
    - Incorporate timeliness if there have been recent updates or regulatory changes.
        
    - Avoid hype; focus on reassuring readers that the article covers their concerns.
        
    - When relevant, mention a unique feature or benefit (“Interactive Map Included,” “Updated for New Laws”).
        
    - Resist generic hooks (“Find Out Now”); the value lies in the answers themselves.
        
- **Style, tone and formatting rules:**
    
    - Use direct, informative language; avoid flowery prose or ambiguous phrasing.
        
    - Maintain an objective, helpful tone; do not insert personal opinion or persuasive language unless clearly marked.
        
    - Follow SEO best practices: include the subject keyword naturally but avoid stuffing.
        
    - Write in the present tense; avoid sensationalism or urgency cues (“Act now,” “Limited time”).
        
    - Ensure the headline level matches the article’s scope; if the FAQ covers a narrow subtopic, specify it (“Visa FAQ for Digital Nomads in Spain”).
        
    - Avoid rhetorical devices; keep the promise straightforward and credible.
        
    - Use consistent capitalisation and avoid exclamation marks or ellipses.
        
- **Preferred words and phrases:**
    
    - “FAQ,” “Frequently Asked Questions,” “Your Questions Answered,” “Complete guide,” “Everything you need to know,” “Essential info,” “Top questions about,” “Answers to,” “What to know,” “Expert answers,” “Comprehensive,” “Detailed guide,” “In‑depth,” “Common queries,” “Updated.”
        
- **Words and patterns to avoid:**
    
    - Clickbait triggers (“Secrets revealed,” “Shocking answers,” “What they don’t tell you”).
        
    - Sensational adjectives (“Crazy,” “Insane,” “Epic”) and hype (“Breakthrough”).
        
    - Over‑promised comprehensiveness (“Absolutely every question answered”) unless truly exhaustive.
        
    - Ambiguous hooks (“Stuff you need,” “All about”).
        
    - Negative imperatives (“Don’t ask again,” “Stop worrying and read this”).
        
    - Unrelated buzzwords inserted for SEO (“Ultimate hack,” “Life‑changing”).
        
    - Salesy language (“Best deals,” “Huge discount”) unless the FAQ is specifically about deals and clearly labelled.
        
- **Final quality checklist:**
    
    - Does the title clearly identify the piece as an FAQ and name the subject?
        
    - Is the promise of comprehensive answers honest and proportionate to the content?
        
    - Is the tone neutral, helpful and free of hype or clickbait?
        
    - Are keywords integrated naturally and appropriately for search engines?
        
    - Is the length concise and readable (≤65 characters)?
        
    - Have you avoided unnecessary numbers or exaggerated claims?
        
    - Does the title adhere to headline style (capitalisation, no unnecessary articles or punctuation)?
        
    - Have you ensured the title aligns with the article’s scope and audience needs?
