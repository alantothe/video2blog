## Case Study

- **Purpose of titles:** Convey who the case study is about and the measurable outcome achieved, building trust and demonstrating credibility. A good case study headline should answer common reader questions about relevance and value.
    
- **Audience mindset:** Readers want proof that a product, service, or approach works and look for specific, results‑oriented stories relevant to their situation.
    
- **Title structure rules:**
    
    - Include the featured customer’s name or industry to establish relevance.
        
    - State the product or service used so readers know the context.
        
    - Highlight the main benefit or result using a hard number where possible.
        
    - Use a clear, concise structure such as “Client/Industry – Result – Method,” keeping it under roughly 70–80 characters.
        
    - Consider a subtitle to provide extra detail if the main title is short.
        
    - Make sure the title mirrors the story’s focus and is not clickbait.
        
    - Lightly incorporate keywords for SEO without sacrificing clarity.
        
- **Hook and angle strategy:**
    
    - Lead with the quantifiable result (e.g., percentages, dollars saved) to grab attention.
        
    - Show transformation or improvement to appeal to readers’ aspirations.
        
    - Emphasize the challenge solved to connect with the reader’s pain points.
        
    - Use industry‑specific terms to speak directly to the target audience.
        
    - Convey credibility by naming recognizable customers when possible.
        
    - Offer a concise preview of how the result was achieved (e.g., “using [method]”).
        
    - Avoid superlatives; instead, promise realistic and measurable takeaways.
        
- **Style, tone, and formatting rules:**
    
    - Professional, authoritative and fact‑driven; let the data speak for itself.
        
    - Use active voice and action verbs (“boosts,” “reduces,” “increases”).
        
    - Keep wording simple; avoid jargon unless essential to the industry.
        
    - Capitalize important words according to the publication’s style (sentence or title case).
        
    - Maintain neutrality; focus on results rather than hype.
        
    - Ensure the tone aligns with the seriousness of a case study, but remain engaging.
        
- **Preferred words and phrases:**
    
    - “Increases,” “reduces,” “improves,” “boosts,” “achieves,” “saves”
        
    - “By [number]%” or “by [number] [units]”
        
    - “Cutting costs,” “driving growth,” “streamlining,” “accelerating”
        
    - “Case study,” “story,” “example,” “success”
        
    - “Real‑world,” “verified,” “measurable,” “data‑driven”
        
    - “How [client] [achieved result]”
        
    - Industry descriptors (e.g., “hospital,” “e‑commerce brand”) to signal relevance
        
    - “Using [product/service]” or “with [tool]”
        
- **Words and patterns to avoid:**
    
    - Clickbait phrases (“shocking,” “unbelievable,” “secret,” “you won’t believe”)
        
    - Vague descriptors (“amazing results,” “huge success”) without numbers
        
    - Superlatives that overpromise (“best ever,” “ultimate”) unless backed by data
        
    - Excessive jargon or acronyms unfamiliar to general readers
        
    - Overly long titles that bury the result or customer name
        
    - Negative framing or sensationalist language
        
    - Puns or jokes that reduce professionalism
        
    - Redundant words (e.g., repeating the company name and logo in the title)
        
- **Final quality checklist:**
    
    - Does the title include the customer/industry, the solution used, and a measurable outcome?
        
    - Is the result expressed with a specific number or clear benefit?
        
    - Is the title free of clickbait and hype and under roughly 70–80 characters?
        
    - Have you used active, plain language and avoided jargon?
        
    - Does the title align with the reader’s search intent and include relevant keywords?
        
    - If needed, is there a subtitle providing context without cluttering the main title?
        
    - Does the headline set accurate expectations about the story’s content?
        
    - Have you checked spelling, capitalization, and style consistency?
        
    - Would a prospective reader instantly know who the story is about and what they’ll learn?
