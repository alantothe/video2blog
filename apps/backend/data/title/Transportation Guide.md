## Transportation Guide

- **Purpose of titles:** Provide a succinct roadmap to getting around a destination by outlining modes of transport, costs and logistics. The title should promise practical navigation help without ambiguity.
    
- **Audience mindset:** Readers want straightforward, efficient guidance for moving within or to a place; they value convenience, clarity and local insight.
    
- **Title structure rules:**
    
    - Begin with the destination followed by a transport‑focused noun phrase (“Transportation Guide,” “Getting Around”) to immediately anchor the subject.
        
    - Include the primary modes or themes (e.g., “Metro, Bus & Ferry”) to show breadth of coverage; use commas or a colon to separate elements.
        
    - Use “How to…” or “Guide to…” constructions for specific transportation topics (e.g., “How to Travel Italy by Train”).
        
    - Keep the title around 70–90 characters and roughly eight words for readability and SEO.
        
    - Front‑load destination names and key transport terms so searchers immediately understand relevance.
        
    - Use numerals to denote route numbers or tips when appropriate, and abbreviate months or days if included.
        
    - Avoid starting with a verb; include a subject and active verb phrase.
        
- **Hook and angle strategy:**
    
    - Emphasize ease, efficiency or cost savings to appeal to practical travelers.
        
    - Highlight unique local systems or options (bike shares, ferries, ride‑shares) that differentiate the destination.
        
    - Mention seasonality or recent updates (e.g., “2026”) only if it materially affects transport information; avoid unnecessary dates.
        
    - Signal comparative value (“Cheapest Ways to…,” “Fastest Routes”) when the article provides real analysis.
        
    - Use clear benefit statements (“Navigating [City] Like a Local”) to foster trust.
        
    - Consider including accessibility information (wheelchair accessible, family‑friendly) to broaden appeal.
        
- **Style, tone, and formatting rules:**
    
    - Maintain an informative, neutral tone; avoid slang and maintain consistency with brand voice.
        
    - Use present tense and active verbs; avoid command verbs that could misread as imperative.
        
    - Capitalize only the first word and proper nouns; do not end with a period.
        
    - Use commas as substitutes for “and” to keep the title concise.
        
    - Avoid complex punctuation; if necessary, use a colon to separate a broad subject from specific modes.
        
    - Do not duplicate wording from the article’s introduction; keep the headline distinct.
        
- **Preferred words and phrases:**
    
    - “Getting Around”
        
    - “Transportation Guide”
        
    - “How to Get Around”
        
    - “Transit”
        
    - “Metro” / “Subway” / “Train”
        
    - “Bus” / “Ferry” / “Rail”
        
    - “Bike Share”
        
    - “Taxi” / “Ride‑Share”
        
    - “Routes” / “Lines”
        
    - “Passes” / “Tickets”
        
    - “Costs” / “Fares”
        
    - “Schedule”
        
    - “Accessible”
        
    - “Local Tips”
        
    - “Airport Transfers”
        
- **Words and patterns to avoid:**
    
    - Vague descriptors like “Exciting” or “Amazing” that do not convey information.
        
    - Clichés such as “hidden gem transportation” or “best‑kept secret ways”.
        
    - Overly technical jargon that general readers may not understand.
        
    - Hyperbolic phrases (“Ultimate Ride,” “Epic Journey”) unless justified.
        
    - Overpromising language (“Never Get Lost Again!”) that may mislead.
        
    - Unclear abbreviations or nicknames for transit systems unless widely recognized.
        
    - Long lists of modes that clutter the headline; prioritize the most relevant.
        
    - Direct commands (“Stop Taking Taxis!”) unless the article is a clear cautionary guide.
        
- **Final quality checklist:**
    
    - Does the title state the destination and transportation focus up front?
        
    - Are the primary modes or themes clearly and concisely listed?
        
    - Is the headline under ~70–90 characters and free of filler words?
        
    - Does it contain a subject and active verb or clear descriptor, avoiding leading with a verb?
        
    - Are keywords front‑loaded to improve search visibility?
        
    - Does the tone remain informative and non‑sensational?
        
    - Have you avoided clichés, hyperbole and unclear abbreviations?
        
    - Would both locals and visitors find the title understandable and appealing?
        
    - Check capitalization and punctuation according to downstyle rules.
