## Explainer

- **Purpose of titles:** Introduce complex topics or news events by signalling that the article will break down the issue into clear, digestible information. The goal is to inform and educate without assuming prior knowledge.
    
- **Audience mindset:** Readers are curious and perhaps confused about a subject; they want context, clarity and practical takeaways.
    
- **Title structure rules:**
    
    - Start with question words (“What,” “Why,” “How”) or explanatory phrases (“Explained,” “Inside,” “Understanding”) to indicate an explanatory piece.
        
    - Clearly state the topic or issue being explained; avoid vague pronouns or descriptors.
        
    - Use a colon or em dash to separate the topic from the angle when necessary (“How [policy] Affects You: [Key issue] Explained”).
        
    - Keep titles straightforward; avoid multi‑layered wordplay that obscures meaning.
        
    - Limit length to ~60–70 characters to ensure readability and SEO friendliness.
        
    - Use present tense and active voice to convey immediacy.
        
    - Do not ask rhetorical questions that imply a predetermined answer; if using a question, ensure the article truly addresses it.
        
    - When appropriate, indicate the timeframe (“What the 2026 Recession Means for Jobseekers”); ensure dates are accurate and relevant.
        
- **Hook and angle strategy:**
    
    - Highlight why the topic matters to the reader (e.g., impact on daily life, financial implications, cultural significance).
        
    - Clarify misconceptions or answer common questions (“What’s behind the surge in…,” “Why does… matter?”).
        
    - Use phrases like “What you need to know,” “Key takeaways,” or “Breaking down the basics” to promise clarity and brevity.
        
    - Incorporate context or comparisons that help frame the issue (“Comparing X and Y,” “Inside the debate over…”).
        
    - Avoid framing the piece as sensational or exposing secrets; emphasise understanding and insight.
        
    - Offer a forward‑looking element when relevant (“What’s next for…,” “How this could change…”).
        
    - Draw readers in with specificity rather than generality (e.g., “Why [specific law] Could Reshape [industry]”).
        
- **Style, tone and formatting rules:**
    
    - Maintain an authoritative yet approachable tone; avoid jargon and explain technical terms.
        
    - Use simple, clear language; aim for a 10th‑grade reading level or lower.
        
    - Uphold accuracy and integrity; never sacrifice clarity for cleverness.
        
    - Incorporate relevant keywords naturally for SEO but avoid keyword stuffing.
        
    - Avoid clickbait triggers (“Secret,” “Shocking truth,” “Insider”) that promise revelations.
        
    - Use consistent capitalisation and punctuation; avoid exclamation marks or ellipses.
        
    - Make sure the headline matches the article’s scope; don’t oversell the depth or simplicity of the explanation.
        
- **Preferred words and phrases:**
    
    - “Explained,” “What you need to know,” “Understanding,” “Inside,” “Why it matters,” “Breaking down,” “Key takeaways,” “Guide to,” “Impact of,” “What’s next,” “Behind the scenes,” “How it works,” “Unpacking,” “In context,” “For beginners.”
        
- **Words and patterns to avoid:**
    
    - Sensational descriptors (“Shocking,” “Explosive,” “Revealed”) that imply scandal.
        
    - Overpromising phrases (“Everything you’ll ever need to know,” “The only article you need”).
        
    - Clickbait tropes (“You won’t believe,” “What happens next will amaze you”).
        
    - Jargon or acronyms without explanations (“XYZ Act,” “FTSE crash”) unless spelled out in the article.
        
    - Negative framing that induces fear without justification (“Disaster explained,” “Why you should panic about…”).
        
    - Vague generalities (“All about,” “Stuff you should know”) that do not specify the angle.
        
    - Question–answer patterns that mislead (“Is X the next Y? The answer will shock you”).
        
- **Final quality checklist:**
    
    - Does the title clearly indicate that the article is an explainer and identify the specific topic?
        
    - Is the question or phrase answered directly in the article?
        
    - Are the reasons for the article’s importance evident or implied in the title?
        
    - Is the language clear, neutral and free from jargon or sensationalism?
        
    - Is the length appropriate and keywords well integrated?
        
    - Are temporal references (years, seasons) accurate and necessary?
        
    - Does the title avoid clickbait, rhetorical questions and overpromising?
        
    - Has proper headline style been followed (capitalisation, punctuation, present tense)?
