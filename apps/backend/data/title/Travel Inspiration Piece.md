## Travel Inspiration Piece

- **Purpose of titles:** Spark readers’ wanderlust by showcasing compelling reasons or unique aspects of a destination or experience. The title should inspire curiosity and excitement without resorting to hype.
    
- **Audience mindset:** Readers are daydreaming or planning future trips; they crave novel ideas and emotional resonance, but expect honesty and specificity.
    
- **Title structure rules:**
    
    - Lead with the destination or theme followed by a compelling descriptor or promise (“X Reasons to Visit…,” “Discover the Magic of…”).
        
    - Use numbers, if appropriate, to structure the content (“7 Epic Road Trips”) but avoid inflated lists that promise more than delivered.
        
    - Front‑load important keywords and keep titles within 70–90 characters.
        
    - Use adjectives sparingly; choose specific, evocative words over generic clichés.
        
    - Employ a colon to separate a general theme from a specific angle (“Bucket‑List Adventures: Exploring…”) when helpful.
        
    - Do not start with a verb; ensure there is a clear subject.
        
    - Avoid unnecessary articles and conjunctions to keep the title concise.
        
- **Hook and angle strategy:**
    
    - Highlight unique experiences, cultural highlights or natural wonders that readers may not know.
        
    - Emphasize emotional payoffs (“Why [Destination] Should Be on Your Bucket List”) while avoiding sensationalism.
        
    - Use seasonal or thematic angles (“Autumn Escapes,” “Island Retreats for Winter”) to tap into timely interest.
        
    - Consider aspirational phrases like “Dreaming of…,” “Escape to…” for mood pieces, ensuring they are balanced with specific details.
        
    - For list articles, specify what the list covers (e.g., adventures, sights, itineraries) to manage expectations.
        
    - Avoid hyperbole and be transparent about the content to build trust.
        
- **Style, tone, and formatting rules:**
    
    - Maintain an uplifting, descriptive tone that conveys excitement and possibility.
        
    - Use active voice and present tense, but avoid commands or imperatives that sound like clickbait.
        
    - Use sentence case capitalization; avoid ending punctuation unless posing a genuine question.
        
    - Keep language accessible and inclusive, avoiding jargon or overly technical terms.
        
    - Avoid superfluous exclamation points or emojis; rely on word choice to convey emotion.
        
    - If using adjectives, choose specific descriptors that paint a clear picture (“snow‑capped peaks,” “vibrant markets”) instead of vague terms like “amazing.”
        
- **Preferred words and phrases:**
    
    - “Discover” / “Explore” / “Experience”
        
    - “Reasons to Visit” / “Why You Should Visit”
        
    - “Bucket List” / “Must‑Visit”
        
    - “Iconic” / “Spectacular” / “Unforgettable”
        
    - “Journey” / “Adventure” / “Escape”
        
    - “Hidden History” / “Lesser‑Known” (use carefully and substantiate)
        
    - “Wander” / “Dreaming of”
        
    - “Vibrant” / “Picturesque” / “Majestic”
        
    - “Culinary Delights” / “Cultural Gems”
        
    - “Outdoor Adventures” / “Nature Escapes”
        
    - “Inspiration” / “Inspiring”
        
    - “Off‑Peak” / “Seasonal”
        
    - “Iconic Landmarks”
        
    - “Epic Road Trips”
        
- **Words and patterns to avoid:**
    
    - Overused clichés like “Hidden Gem,” “Breathtaking Views,” “Land of Contrasts,” “A Place That Time Forgot”.
        
    - Sensational phrases such as “You Won’t Believe,” “Mind‑Blowing,” “Jaw‑Dropping”.
        
    - Generic adjectives like “Stunning,” “Amazing,” “Lovely,” “Beautiful” without context.
        
    - Overpromising superlatives (“Ultimate,” “Best‑Ever,” “Life‑Changing”) unless objective and verifiable.
        
    - Misused words identified in travel writing critiques such as “Galore,” “Hip,” “Nestled,” “Atop,” “Eatery,” “Bustling”.
        
    - Unsubstantiated buzzwords (“Eco‑Paradise,” “Authentic”) unless explained.
        
    - Fear‑based or negative hooks (“Last Chance,” “Before It Disappears”) that create artificial urgency.
        
    - Second‑person gimmicks (“You Need This Trip Now!”) that feel like advertisements.
        
- **Final quality checklist:**
    
    - Does the title evoke curiosity and inspiration while clearly indicating the destination or theme?
        
    - Is the headline concise and within ~90 characters, with keywords front‑loaded?
        
    - Have you avoided clichés and hyperbolic adjectives?
        
    - Does the title promise specific value (reasons, experiences, highlights) rather than vague excitement?
        
    - Is the tone aspirational yet honest, avoiding clickbait traps?
        
    - Are adjectives chosen carefully to paint a vivid picture without resorting to overused descriptors?
        
    - Does the structure include a clear subject and avoid starting with a verb?
        
    - Is punctuation minimal and capitalization consistent with downstyle?
        
    - Would the title stand out in a newsletter, search result or social feed for the right reasons?
