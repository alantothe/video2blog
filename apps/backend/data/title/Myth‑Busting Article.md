## Myth‑Busting Article

- **Purpose of titles (1–2 lines)**
    
    Titles for myth‑busting pieces should quickly signal that the article will correct a misconception and deliver trustworthy information. The focus is on revealing the truth rather than sensationalizing or repeating false claims.
    
- **Audience mindset (1 line)**
    
    Readers are curious but may hold misconceptions; they want clear facts and reassurance from credible sources.
    
- **Title structure rules (5–8 bullet points)**
    
    - Begin with the correct fact or conclusion; avoid leading with the myth itself because repeating falsehoods can reinforce them.
        
    - Use active verbs and state what the article will prove (e.g., “explains,” “shows,” “reveals”).
        
    - Include the subject or topic and a concise descriptor so the title stands alone on social feeds.
        
    - Keep titles short and snappy; they should come from the article’s content and not introduce new information.
        
    - Use sentence case: capitalize the first word and proper nouns.
        
    - Where helpful, use a colon to introduce a clarifying phrase and capitalize the first word after the colon.
        
    - Avoid articles (a, an, the) and forms of “to be” to conserve space and improve punch.
        
    - Ensure the title answers the reader’s question “Why should I read this?”.
        
- **Hook and angle strategy (5–8 bullet points)**
    
    - Use an “against popular belief” angle to allude to a widely held assumption and flip it with an opposing fact.
        
    - Pose a clear “why” or “how” question that invites the reader to learn the truth.
        
    - When appropriate, incorporate numbers (“3 facts about…”) or data‑driven language to signal evidence.
        
    - Tie the myth to a timely trend or current event to increase relevance.
        
    - Use brackets or parentheses to clarify the myth being addressed without repeating it verbatim.
        
    - Emphasize simplicity and memorability; focus on what readers should remember, not the falsehood.
        
    - Highlight benefits or consequences (“why it matters” or “what you should know”) to create urgency.
        
- **Style, tone, and formatting rules (5–8 bullet points)**
    
    - Maintain a neutral, authoritative tone; avoid sensational adjectives and clickbait language.
        
    - Use present tense and active voice; for future events, use “to” plus a verb (e.g., “to examine”).
        
    - Keep language simple and easy to scan for digital audiences.
        
    - Avoid single‑word labels; include verbs rather than just nouns.
        
    - Do not capitalize every word; stick to sentence case and only capitalize proper nouns and the first word.
        
    - Refrain from repeating the myth; frame the headline around the correct information.
        
    - Include keywords that align with the topic for searchability.
        
- **Preferred words and phrases (8–15 bullet points)**
    
    - “Fact check”
        
    - “The truth about”
        
    - “What you need to know”
        
    - “Why” / “How” (followed by topic)
        
    - “Here’s why”
        
    - “Actually”
        
    - “Evidence shows”
        
    - “Data‑driven”
        
    - “Research reveals”
        
    - “Reality check”
        
    - “Surprising facts”
        
    - “Explained”
        
    - “Debunking”
        
    - “Myth vs. reality”
        
    - “Clarifying”
        
- **Words and patterns to avoid (8–15 bullet points)**
    
    - Repeating the myth in full or using quotes of misinformation.
        
    - Sensational phrases like “You won’t believe,” “Shocking,” or “Mind‑blowing.”
        
    - Generic exclamations or clickbait (“Crazy truth,” “Everything you know is wrong”).
        
    - Unverifiable superlatives (“biggest,” “ultimate”) unless supported by data.
        
    - Slang or casual language (“junk,” “BS”).
        
    - Humorous sarcasm that may trivialize the subject.
        
    - Negatively framed questions that suggest the myth might be true.
        
    - Terms like “fake news” or “myth‑busting” used repetitively; instead use more descriptive phrases.
        
    - Passive constructions (“It is said that…”).
        
- **Final quality checklist (6–10 bullet points)**
    
    - Confirm the headline communicates the correct information rather than the myth.
        
    - Ensure it is concise (ideally under 12 words) and uses active voice.
        
    - Check that it can stand alone on social media or search results and clearly conveys the topic and benefit.
        
    - Verify sentence case and proper noun capitalization.
        
    - Remove articles and forms of “to be” where possible.
        
    - Include relevant keywords without stuffing.
        
    - Avoid repeating misinformation or sensational phrasing.
        
    - Align tone with the publication’s voice—professional, trustworthy and free of clickbait.
