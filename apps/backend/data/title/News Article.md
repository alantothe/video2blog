## News Article

- **Purpose of titles (1–2 lines)**
    
    News headlines should succinctly convey the most important facts about an event or announcement and entice readers to learn more. They set expectations for timely, accurate reporting.
    
- **Audience mindset (1 line)**
    
    Readers scan headlines for quick updates and expect clarity, timeliness and impartiality.
    
- **Title structure rules (5–8 bullet points)**
    
    - Summarize who and what happened, and include where or when if essential.
        
    - Use present tense even for past events; future events can use “to” + verb (e.g., “to open”).
        
    - Keep headlines short, drawn from the article body and avoid introducing new information.
        
    - Use active verbs; avoid forms of “to be” and other weak verbs.
        
    - Omit articles (a, an, the) and unnecessary prepositions.
        
    - Capitalize only the first word and proper nouns (sentence case).
        
    - If a colon is used, capitalize the first word after it and ensure the second phrase expands on the first.
        
    - Ensure consistency in headline style across the publication; avoid mixing verb‑driven headlines with simple labels.
        
- **Hook and angle strategy (5–8 bullet points)**
    
    - Highlight the most newsworthy element or impact of the story (e.g., scale, consequences, novelty).
        
    - Include numbers or data when they add clarity and interest.
        
    - Tie the headline to a current trend or timely context to boost relevance.
        
    - Use precise verbs such as “announces,” “approves,” “faces,” or “votes to.”
        
    - Add locality when relevant to attract readers in a specific region.
        
    - Avoid sensational adjectives; let the facts provide the interest.
        
    - For breaking news, emphasize immediacy (“now,” “today,” “new”).
        
- **Style, tone, and formatting rules (5–8 bullet points)**
    
    - Maintain an objective, unbiased tone; avoid opinion or speculation in news headlines.
        
    - Use simple, familiar words that readers can scan quickly.
        
    - Stick to sentence case and avoid ALL CAPS or unnecessary punctuation.
        
    - Avoid abbreviations unless widely recognized (e.g., “UN,” “NASA”).
        
    - Do not ask questions; news headlines should state facts.
        
    - Avoid clickbait phrases or exaggerated claims.
        
    - Keep the headline under 8–12 words when possible to maintain punch.
        
- **Preferred words and phrases (8–15 bullet points)**
    
    - “Announces”
        
    - “To open” / “to launch”
        
    - “Approves” / “passes”

- **Words and patterns to avoid (8–15 bullet points)**
    
    - Articles (“a,” “an,” “the”).
        
    - Forms of “to be” (is, was, were).
        
    - Past‑tense verbs (“said,” “announced”)—use present tense instead.
        
    - Clickbait phrases (“You won’t believe,” “Shocking”).
        
    - Exclamation points or question marks.
        
    - Vague pronouns (“They,” “He”) without clear antecedent.
        
    - Unverified superlatives (“best ever,” “biggest”).
        
    - Emotional or subjective adjectives (“amazing,” “horrific”)—stick to facts.
        
    - Jargon or technical abbreviations unknown to general readers.
        
    - Ambiguous headlines that could apply to multiple stories.
        
- **Final quality checklist (6–10 bullet points)**
    
    - Verify that the headline reflects the key facts—who, what, where, and sometimes when.
        
    - Confirm present‑tense verbs and active voice.
        
    - Remove articles and unnecessary words.
        
    - Check sentence case and proper noun capitalization.
        
    - Ensure the headline stands alone and makes sense without the article body.
        
    - Avoid adding opinions or speculative language.
        
    - Keep the length concise and scan‑friendly.
        
    - Use a consistent style across similar stories.
        
    - Include relevant keywords for SEO without sacrificing clarity.
        
    - Double‑check spelling of names, places and abbreviations.
