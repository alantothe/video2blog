## Survival Guide

- **Purpose of titles:** Clearly signal that the article provides practical advice for staying safe and prepared in specific situations or places. Titles should convey the promise of guidance and reassurance without sensationalizing danger.
    
- **Audience mindset:** Readers are seeking trustworthy, actionable information to mitigate risks or challenges in an unfamiliar environment.
    
- **Title structure rules:**
    
    - Start with a clear subject (hazard or location) followed by a strong, active verb or descriptor; avoid label headlines.
        
    - Use service‑oriented formats such as “How to…,” “X Essential Tips for…,” or “Guide to…” to indicate actionable content.
        
    - Front‑load important keywords (e.g., destination, hazard) within the first 70 characters to aid clarity and SEO.
        
    - Keep titles concise (generally under eight words or ~70 characters) so they are not truncated and remain easy to scan.
        
    - Use numerals and abbreviations where appropriate for brevity.
        
    - Capitalize only the first word and proper nouns, and avoid articles and conjunctions like “a,” “an,” and “and”.
        
    - Avoid starting with a verb; every headline should imply a complete sentence.
        
- **Hook and angle strategy:**
    
    - Highlight the specific challenge or risk the reader will learn to overcome (e.g., altitude sickness, desert survival).
        
    - Emphasize urgency or importance without fear‑mongering; convey a sense of preparedness and empowerment.
        
    - Include concrete benefits or outcomes (“Avoid Altitude Sickness,” “Stay Safe During…”) to communicate value.
        
    - Mention audience‑relevant contexts (backpackers, solo travellers, families) to personalize the guidance.
        
    - Use authoritative language and signal expertise (“Expert Tips,” “Proven Strategies”).
        
    - When appropriate, incorporate a timeline or season (“Winter Survival Guide”) to convey relevance.
        
    - Avoid sensational phrases (“Shocking,” “Terrifying”) that erode trust.
        
- **Style, tone, and formatting rules:**
    
    - Maintain a calm, authoritative tone; avoid hyperbole and fear‑based language.
        
    - Use present tense and active verbs to make the guidance feel immediate and practical.
        
    - Do not use periods at the end of the headline; question marks are acceptable only when the article genuinely answers a question.
        
    - Use a colon to separate a primary statement from a clarifying clause if needed (e.g., “Desert Survival: How to Conserve Water”).
        
    - Avoid clever puns or wordplay; clarity and safety should come first.
        
- **Preferred words and phrases:**
    
    - “How to”
        
    - “Essential” / “Must‑Know”
        
    - “Safety” / “Safe”
        
    - “Emergency”
        
    - “Prepare” / “Prep”
        
    - “Survive” / “Survival”
        
    - “Guide” / “Manual”
        
    - “Tips” / “Strategies”
        
    - “Checklist”
        
    - “Hazards” / “Risks”
        
    - “Emergency Kit”
        
    - “Step‑by‑Step”
        
    - “Stay [Adjective]” (e.g., “Stay Warm,” “Stay Dry”)
        
    - “Backcountry” / “Remote”
        
- **Words and patterns to avoid:**
    
    - Clickbait phrases (“You Won’t Believe,” “Shocking,” “Mind‑Blowing”).
        
    - Hyperbolic adjectives (“Breathtaking,” “Jaw‑Dropping”).
        
    - Clichés like “Hidden Gem,” “Off the Beaten Path,” or “Land of Contrasts”.
        
    - Sensational fear‑mongering (“Terrifying,” “Disaster,” “Nightmare”) when not warranted.
        
    - Overused descriptors (“Ultimate,” “Epic,” “Life‑Changing”) that cannot be substantiated.
        
    - Unnecessary slang or colloquialisms (“Hack,” “Secret Sauce”).
        
    - Second‑person commands (“Don’t Do This”) unless the article is a true cautionary list.
        
    - Vague words like “Beautiful,” “Amazing,” “Interesting” that lack specificity.
        
- **Final quality checklist:**
    
    - Does the title clearly state the subject and the survival challenge or hazard?
        
    - Is the wording concise (under ~70 characters) and free of unnecessary articles or conjunctions?
        
    - Does the headline include a strong, active verb and avoid starting with a verb?
        
    - Is the tone calm, informative, and trustworthy (no clickbait or hype)?
        
    - Are the most important keywords front‑loaded for SEO and clarity?
        
    - Does the title imply a complete thought and reflect the article’s value?
        
    - Have you avoided clichés and overused travel descriptors?
        
    - Would the title appeal equally on a news feed, search result, newsletter or homepage?
        
    - Double‑check spelling, grammar and adherence to downstyle capitalization.
