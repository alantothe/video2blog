## When to Visit Article

- **Purpose of titles:** Advise readers on the best times to travel to a destination by considering weather, crowds, events and prices. The title should promise seasonal guidance and help readers plan strategically.
    
- **Audience mindset:** Readers are weighing timing for their travel and want practical insights on seasonal conditions, events and value.
    
- **Title structure rules:**
    
    - Start with the phrase “Best Time to Visit [Destination]” or “When to Visit [Destination]” to immediately signal the article’s purpose.
        
    - Use modifiers that hint at the type of guidance (“Weather & Events Guide,” “Seasonal Breakdown”) to add specificity.
        
    - If relevant, include the year or range (e.g., “in 2026”) to indicate updated information; avoid unnecessary dates if content is evergreen.
        
    - Keep titles concise, ideally within eight to ten words and under 90 characters.
        
    - Use numerals for months or seasons when summarizing (“Spring vs. Fall”) and abbreviate months where space is tight.
        
    - Avoid starting with a verb; include a clear subject and avoid article or conjunction clutter.
        
    - Consider a colon to separate the main statement from a supporting detail (“Best Time to Visit Japan: Weather, Crowds & Deals”).
        
- **Hook and angle strategy:**
    
    - Emphasize the benefits of visiting during specific seasons (e.g., “Cherry Blossom Season,” “Shoulder Season Bargains”).
        
    - Highlight contrasts between peak and off‑peak periods (“Avoid Crowds by Traveling in…”).
        
    - Incorporate key events or festivals that might attract readers (“During the Lantern Festival”).
        
    - Promise actionable insight (“Weather, Crowds, and Prices Explained”) rather than vague excitement.
        
    - Mention types of travelers if the article tailors advice (families, budget travelers, adventure seekers).
        
    - Avoid clickbait urgency; the value lies in thoughtful planning guidance.
        
- **Style, tone, and formatting rules:**
    
    - Use an informative, advisory tone; avoid exaggeration or hyperbole.
        
    - Write in present tense with active verbs to enhance immediacy.
        
    - Follow downstyle capitalization; omit end punctuation.
        
    - Avoid unnecessary adjectives; focus on factual descriptors like “rainy,” “dry,” “crowded,” “quiet.”
        
    - Keep language accessible and avoid jargon.
        
    - Refrain from using overly poetic or metaphorical language in place of clear descriptors.
        
- **Preferred words and phrases:**
    
    - “Best Time to Visit” / “When to Visit”
        
    - “Seasonal Guide” / “Seasonal Breakdown”
        
    - “Weather & Crowds”
        
    - “Peak vs Off‑Peak”
        
    - “Rainy Season” / “Dry Season”
        
    - “Festival Season” / “Events Calendar”
        
    - “Month‑by‑Month”
        
    - “Spring” / “Summer” / “Autumn/Fall” / “Winter”
        
    - “Crowds & Prices”
        
    - “Shoulder Season”
        
    - “Travel Deals”
        
    - “Holiday Periods”
        
    - “Best Months for [Activity]”
        
    - “Year‑Round Guide”
        
    - “Updated [Year]”
        
- **Words and patterns to avoid:**
    
    - Vague superlatives (“Perfect,” “Ultimate,” “Top”) that don’t convey timing.
        
    - Clichés like “Hidden Gem Seasons,” “Best‑Kept Secret Time”.
        
    - Overused adjectives such as “Stunning,” “Incredible,” “Beautiful” when the focus is timing rather than scenery.
        
    - Sensational or fear‑based phrases (“Don’t Go Unless…,” “Avoid at All Costs”) that misrepresent normal seasonal variations.
        
    - Misused travel words (“Nestled,” “Cozy,” “Bustling”) irrelevant to scheduling.
        
    - Clickbait constructs (“You Won’t Believe When to Go”).
        
    - Long lists of events without context that clutter the headline.
        
    - Ambiguous timeframes (“Soon,” “Later”) lacking specificity.
        
- **Final quality checklist:**
    
    - Does the title explicitly state it’s about timing for a specific destination?
        
    - Is the headline concise (under ~90 characters) with primary keywords front‑loaded?
        
    - Have you included relevant seasonal descriptors or events to provide context?
        
    - Does the title avoid clichés, generic adjectives and clickbait?
        
    - Is the tone advisory and factual rather than sensational or poetic?
        
    - Have you used proper capitalization and avoided punctuation at the end?
        
    - Are any dates included current and necessary to indicate updated information?
        
    - Would someone planning a trip immediately know the article will help them decide when to go?
        
    - Have you checked for grammar, spelling and consistency with style guidelines?
