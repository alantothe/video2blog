## Solo Travel Guide

### Purpose of titles

Solo travel guide titles should inspire and empower individual travellers by signalling that the article offers advice, encouragement and practical tips for navigating trips alone.

### Audience mindset

Readers are adventurous yet cautious, often seeking self‑discovery, independence and reassurance about safety and logistics.

### Title structure rules

- Begin with an inviting, empowering phrase (“Solo Travel Guide,” “Tips for travelling alone”).
    
- Include the destination or context (country, region or type of travel) so readers can identify relevance.
    
- Use adjectives that emphasise personal growth and confidence (e.g., “empowering,” “stress‑free,” “safe”).
    
- Keep within approximately 11 words or 65 characters; include numerals when listing tips.
    
- Use active, positive voice; avoid negative phrasing and filler articles.
    
- Avoid cliché descriptors; opt for specific, descriptive words instead.
    
- Mention a particular demographic (solo female travellers, over‑50, LGBTQ+) when the guide is tailored.
    
- Add a timeframe (e.g., “Updated for 2026”) when content may age quickly.
    

### Hook and angle strategy

- Highlight empowerment and freedom inherent in solo travel, underscoring personal growth and flexibility.
    
- Address common concerns (safety, loneliness, budget) to demonstrate the guide’s practical value.
    
- Promise insider tips or lesser‑known insights without resorting to hype.
    
- Avoid sensationalism; provide realistic encouragement and balanced perspectives.
    
- Reference authority or expertise (e.g., experienced solo travellers) to build trust.
    
- Use inclusive language to appeal to a broad audience; do not assume prior experience.
    
- Tailor the angle to niche interests (foodie, adventure, wellness) to attract specific readers.
    
- Balance aspirational tone with honesty about challenges.
    

### Style, tone, and formatting rules

- Warm, encouraging and informative tone that fosters confidence.
    
- Use plain language; be specific and honest about both challenges and joys.
    
- Avoid clichés like “hidden gem,” “must‑see,” “breathtaking,” or “place that time forgot”.
    
- Use numerals for steps or tips; maintain clarity and brevity.
    
- Write in present tense and active voice, speaking directly to the reader.
    
- Avoid hyperbole and unrealistic promises; be candid about realistic expectations.
    
- Use culturally sensitive and inclusive language; avoid stereotypes or exoticising phrases.
    
- Keep punctuation simple; limit the use of colons or dashes.

- Jargon or abbreviations unknown to general readers.
    
- Passive voice and past tense that reduce immediacy.
    
- Stereotypical or exoticising language that reduces cultures to caricatures.
