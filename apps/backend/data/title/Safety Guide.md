## Safety Guide

### Purpose of titles

Safety guide titles should inform readers that the article provides actionable advice to protect their well‑being. They must inspire confidence, not fear.

### Audience mindset

Readers may feel anxious about risks and are seeking reliable, authoritative guidance that empowers them to act safely.

### Title structure rules

- Open with an action‑oriented phrase indicating guidance (“How to stay safe,” “Safety tips for,” “Guide to avoiding”).
    
- Clearly state the subject or context (e.g., solo travellers, winter hiking, food allergies).
    
- Include a timeframe or specific event if relevant (e.g., “in 2026,” “during hurricane season”).
    
- Use plain language and familiar words.
    
- Maintain conciseness (≈11 words/65 characters) and make the title meaningful without the article.
    
- Use active voice and positive statements; avoid negative phrasing.
    
- Incorporate words like “Guide,” “Safety tips,” or “Checklist” to signal the format.
    
- Avoid emotive adjectives; favour descriptive, factual wording.
    

### Hook and angle strategy

- Emphasise empowerment and preparedness: highlight that the guide equips readers with actionable steps.
    
- Offer reassurance by focusing on protective measures rather than dwelling on hazards.
    
- Reference authoritative sources or expert recommendations where appropriate to build trust.
    
- Use specificity to demonstrate unique value (e.g., “for solo female travellers,” “for families with toddlers”).
    
- Avoid sensationalism; do not exaggerate risks or mislead readers.
    
- Appeal to the reader’s desire for confidence and readiness.
    
- Use terms that imply comprehensiveness and trustworthiness (“essential,” “critical,” “expert‑recommended”).
    
- Balance urgency with calm; encourage action without panic.
    

### Style, tone, and formatting rules

- Clear, calm and authoritative tone that inspires confidence.
    
- Use plain language and get to the point quickly.
    
- Use numerals for lists or steps; limit each heading to about eight words.
    
- Avoid hyperbole, sensational adjectives and clickbait.
    
- Ensure factual accuracy and align with reputable sources.
    
- Use inclusive language; avoid assumptions about gender, ability or experience.
    
- Maintain a consistent formal voice across safety guides.
    
- Spell out or explain abbreviations on first use.

- Clichés and hyperbole such as “breathtaking” or “must‑see”.
    
- Clickbait like “you won’t believe,” “shocking truth”.
    
- Ambiguous language (“various risks,” “many dangers”) without specifics.
    
- Negative instructions when positive statements suffice (e.g., “Don’t forget” vs. “Remember to”).
    
- Overly technical jargon or unexplained acronyms.
    
- Language that incites panic (e.g., “imminent danger,” “critical failure”).
    
- Words that assign blame or shame.
    
- Passive voice or past tense that reduces clarity.
