## Comparison Article

- **Purpose of titles:** Present the items being compared in a neutral, informative way, signalling that the article will help readers choose between them.
    
- **Audience mindset:** Readers are evaluating two or more options and want an unbiased breakdown of differences, advantages, and use cases.
    
- **Title structure rules:**
    
    - Use a clear “X vs Y” or “A vs B” format that mirrors common search queries.
        
    - Keep both names in the same order readers might search; avoid reversing without reason.
        
    - Optionally follow the comparison with a colon or dash and a key differentiator (e.g., “Which Is Better for [Use Case]?”).
        
    - Maintain parity between the compared items; don’t favour one with adjectives in the title.
        
    - Limit the title to around 60–70 characters; ensure both names are fully visible in search results.
        
    - Avoid adding unnecessary modifiers that obscure the comparison.
        
    - Include the category or context if the product names alone are unclear (e.g., “VPN Providers”).
        
    - Use proper capitalization and spacing around “vs” (choose “vs.” or “vs” consistently).
        
- **Hook and angle strategy:**
    
    - Highlight the primary decision factor (price, performance, features) to align with reader intent.
        
    - Use a question (“Which Should You Choose?”) to invite readers into the analysis.
        
    - Convey neutrality by avoiding words that imply a winner in the title.
        
    - Emphasize the reader’s perspective (“for Travelers,” “for Small Businesses”) to target a specific audience.
        
    - If time‑sensitive, include the year to show currency (“in 2026”).
        
    - Encourage exploration by hinting that the article covers pros and cons rather than ranking.
        
    - Avoid hype; instead, promise a thorough, honest comparison.
        
- **Style, tone, and formatting rules:**
    
    - Neutral, objective, and informative; avoid promotional tone.
        
    - Use simple, direct language and avoid jargon unless necessary for clarity.
        
    - Maintain consistent punctuation (e.g., using a colon after the “vs” part if adding a descriptor).
        
    - Follow the publication’s capitalization style for product names and brands.
        
    - Keep the tone authoritative but approachable; don’t be combative.
        
    - Ensure readability; avoid long compound titles.
        
- **Preferred words and phrases:**
    
    - “vs,” “versus,” “comparison”
        
    - “Difference between,” “Which is better,” “Side‑by‑side”
        
    - “Pros and cons,” “Features,” “Pricing,” “Performance,” “Speed”
        
    - “For [specific audience/use case],” “in [year]”
        
    - “How to choose,” “What to consider,” “Which suits you”
        
    - “Head‑to‑head,” “Showdown,” “Face‑off”
        
    - “Best for [goal],” “Better for,” “Ideal for” (used carefully)
        
    - “Detailed,” “Comprehensive”
        
- **Words and patterns to avoid:**
    
    - Bias‑laden adjectives (“killer,” “crushes,” “destroys”) that imply an unfair outcome
        
    - Clickbait (“the ultimate winner will shock you,” “versus fight you can’t miss”)
        
    - Superlatives without context (“best ever,” “world’s greatest”) when comparing
        
    - Insulting or negative language about either option
        
    - Overly technical acronyms without explanation
        
    - Ambiguous names or abbreviations that obscure what’s being compared
        
    - Extremely long titles listing more than two items without clarity
        
    - Inconsistent use of “vs.” versus “vs”; pick one style and adhere to it
        
    - Slang or colloquialisms that undermine neutrality
        
- **Final quality checklist:**
    
    - Does the title clearly state all items being compared and use an appropriate “vs” structure?
        
    - Is the title balanced and free of bias or implied judgments?
        
    - Have you included the main decision factor or context to guide the reader?
        
    - Is the title concise (around 60–70 characters) and scannable?
        
    - Does it reflect how users search for comparison information (e.g., “X vs Y”)?
        
    - Have you avoided hype, clickbait, and subjective adjectives?
        
    - Are the product or brand names spelled correctly and capitalized properly?
        
    - If adding a subtitle, does it elaborate on the comparison without picking a side?
        
    - Would someone unfamiliar with the products know what is being compared?
