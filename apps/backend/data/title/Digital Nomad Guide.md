## Digital Nomad Guide

- **Purpose of titles:** Signal that the article provides practical, location‑specific guidance for remote workers seeking to live and work abroad. Titles should blend travel inspiration with work‑centric logistics.
    
- **Audience mindset:** Readers are current or aspiring digital nomads prioritising infrastructure (internet, visas, coworking) alongside lifestyle and affordability.
    
- **Title structure rules:**
    
    - Include both the destination (city or country) and the phrase “Digital Nomad Guide” or “Remote Work Guide” to make the focus explicit.
        
    - Highlight at least one key pillar—cost of living, coworking spaces, visas, quality of life—to indicate what readers will learn.
        
    - Use concise descriptors separated by colons or em dashes to organise multiple elements (e.g., “Lisbon Digital Nomad Guide: Visas, Coworking & Cost of Living”).
        
    - Limit length to ~60–70 characters; trim secondary details rather than the core promise.
        
    - Use active verbs where possible (“Work Remotely in…,” “Live and Work in…”).
        
    - Avoid vague or generic labels (“Nomad Tips”) that do not specify the type of information provided.
        
    - Include the publication year or update notice only when it reflects major policy changes or new visa options.
        
    - Do not rely on gimmicky numbering; numeric lists are optional, not mandatory.
        
- **Hook and angle strategy:**
    
    - Emphasise remote‑work readiness: fast internet, coworking spaces, community hubs, time‑zone compatibility.
        
    - Highlight affordability (“Low Cost of Living,” “Budget Friendly”) or quality‑of‑life benefits (“Beachside Coworking,” “Cultural Richness”).
        
    - Mention legal frameworks such as digital nomad visas, residency requirements or tax considerations when relevant.
        
    - Appeal to lifestyle aspirations—balance of work and adventure, safety, diversity, wellness.
        
    - Signal timeliness by referencing newly introduced policies or trending nomad destinations.
        
    - Avoid over‑hyping; present practical benefits rather than promising unrealistic freedom or constant travel.
        
    - Offer comparative angles (“Top Digital Nomad City in Asia”) cautiously, ensuring evidence supports such ranking.
        
- **Style, tone and formatting rules:**
    
    - Adopt a pragmatic, informative tone; convey reliability while inspiring curiosity.
        
    - Use present tense and simple sentence structures for clarity.
        
    - Incorporate the keyword “digital nomad” or “remote work” naturally; do not force it multiple times.
        
    - Avoid sensational phrases like “life‑changing” or “unbelievable freedom.”
        
    - When referencing legal topics (visas, taxes), avoid alarmist language; use accurate terminology.
        
    - Ensure inclusive language that applies to diverse readers (solo travellers, couples, families, differently abled nomads).
        
    - Avoid slang specific to niche nomad communities that may alienate general readers.
        
- **Preferred words and phrases:**
    
    - “Digital Nomad Guide,” “Remote Work Guide,” “Nomad Visa,” “Coworking spaces,” “Cost of living,” “Internet speeds,” “Community,” “Workspace,” “Accommodation,” “Safety,” “Healthcare,” “Tax considerations,” “Quality of life,” “Remote‑friendly,” “Coastal city,” “Mountain town,” “Co‑living.”
        
- **Words and patterns to avoid:**
    
    - Hype‑driven terms (“Epic adventure,” “Insane freedom,” “Endless parties”).
        
    - Clickbait (“You won’t believe,” “This one weird trick”).
        
    - Misleading absolutes (“Perfect for everyone,” “Never pay taxes again”).
        
    - Overused superlatives (“#1 city for nomads”) without evidence.
        
    - Vague descriptors (“Nice vibe,” “Cool city”) without context.
        
    - Fear‑mongering (“Dangerous if you don’t read this”) or false urgency (“Act now”).
        
    - Niche jargon (“geoarbitrage,” “hustle culture”) unless the audience is explicitly defined.
        
- **Final quality checklist:**
    
    - Does the title clearly indicate it’s a digital nomad or remote work guide?
        
    - Are the destination and key remote‑work elements present?
        
    - Is the tone practical and trustworthy rather than hyped?
        
    - Are keywords integrated naturally and without stuffing?
        
    - Is the length within ~70 characters and easily scannable?
        
    - Does the title avoid sensationalism and misrepresentation?
        
    - Are any legal or cost claims supported by research in the article?
        
    - Is the language inclusive and free of jargon?
