## Opinion Piece

- **Purpose of titles (1–2 lines)**
    
    Titles for opinion pieces should clearly communicate the author’s argument or perspective and invite readers into a thoughtful commentary. They signal that the content is subjective and designed to persuade or provoke reflection.
    
- **Audience mindset (1 line)**
    
    Readers expect a strong viewpoint backed by reasoning; they are open to new perspectives but want to know the author’s stance before clicking.
    
- **Title structure rules (5–8 bullet points)**
    
    - State the central argument or thesis up front using a strong verb or directive.
        
    - Include the topic and the angle; avoid vague or generic language.
        
    - Use a colon to add context or clarify the argument when beneficial; capitalize the first word after the colon.
        
    - Keep the headline concise (8–14 words) and ensure it stands alone on social feeds.
        
    - Use sentence case; capitalize only the first word and proper nouns.
        
    - If using a rhetorical question, ensure it clearly implies the author’s position (e.g., “Why We Need…”) rather than just teasing.
        
    - When appropriate, signal the format with “Opinion:” or “Commentary:” at the beginning to set expectations.
        
    - Use active voice; avoid forms of “to be” unless essential.
        
- **Hook and angle strategy (5–8 bullet points)**
    
    - Pose a provocative or thought‑provoking question that reflects the article’s main argument.
        
    - Use a “Why” or “How” structure to promise a compelling explanation.
        
    - Tie the argument to current events or trends for relevance.
        
    - Incorporate the writer’s viewpoint or call to action to establish urgency.
        
    - Employ contrasting ideas or play on misconceptions to create interest.
        
    - Emphasize stakes or consequences (“Why ignoring X is dangerous”).
        
    - Use personal voice sparingly; focus on persuasive reasoning rather than self.
        
    - Make the reader feel included by highlighting shared values or concerns.
        
- **Style, tone, and formatting rules (5–8 bullet points)**
    
    - Adopt a persuasive yet respectful tone; avoid inflammatory or derogatory language.
        
    - Use clear, direct language suitable for an eighth‑grade reading level for accessibility.
        
    - Maintain sentence case and avoid excessive capitalization or punctuation.
        
    - Avoid clickbait; the headline should reflect the substance of the opinion.
        
    - Include keywords for SEO but prioritize clarity and reader relevance.
        
    - Use inclusive and gender‑neutral language (e.g., “they” instead of “he/she”).
        
    - Avoid jargon; if specialist terms are necessary, make them clear.
        
    - Steer clear of hyperbolic superlatives unless supported by evidence.
        
- **Preferred words and phrases (8–15 bullet points)**
    
    - “Why” / “How”
        
    - “It’s time to” / “We need to”
        
    - “The case for” / “The case against”
        
    - “Rethinking” / “Reconsidering”
        
    - “A call to”
        
    - “Lessons from”
        
    - “What [issue] really means”
        
    - “Why I [believe/do X]”
        
    - “Making the case”
        
    - “The real reason”
        
    - “Our responsibility”
        
    - “What we can learn”
        
    - “Moving beyond”
        
    - “Challenging the idea”
        
    - “To the editor” (if used for letters)
        
- **Words and patterns to avoid (8–15 bullet points)**
    
    - Clickbait phrases (“You won’t believe,” “Shocking truth”).
        
    - Overuse of “I” or “we” in a way that centers the author over the argument.
        
    - Informal slang or profanity.
        
    - Absolute claims without evidence (“always,” “never”).
        
    - Unnecessary rhetorical questions that do not convey the argument.
        
    - Over‑promising descriptors (“ultimate,” “definitive”) unless warranted.
        
    - Ambiguous pronouns or unclear antecedents.
        
    - Jargon or acronyms unfamiliar to general readers.
        
    - Exclamation marks or question marks used for emphasis.
        
    - Sensational adjectives (“amazing,” “crazy”) not suitable for serious commentary.
        
- **Final quality checklist (6–10 bullet points)**
    
    - Does the headline state or clearly imply the author’s position?
        
    - Is it concise and written in active voice?
        
    - Does it use sentence case and proper nouns correctly?
        
    - Are unnecessary articles and “to be” verbs removed?
        
    - Does the hook align with the argument and avoid clickbait?
        
    - Does the headline stand alone and make sense without additional context?
        
    - Have you used inclusive language and avoided potentially insulting words?
        
    - Are keywords present but not forced?
        
    - Is the tone persuasive yet respectful of differing views?
