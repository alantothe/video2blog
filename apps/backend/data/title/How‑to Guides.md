## How‑to Guides

- **Purpose of titles**: Signal a clear, actionable task or solution and convey the benefit of following the guide.
    
- **Audience mindset**: Readers seeking straightforward instructions or advice to accomplish a task; they value clarity, efficiency, and reliability over intrigue.
    
- **Title structure rules**:
    
    - Lead with the subject and a verb that states the action (e.g., “Plan a Budget Trip,” “Build a Capsule Wardrobe”).
        
    - Avoid beginning with “How to”; instead, weave the “how” element into the action (“Plan a Budget Trip in 5 Steps”).
        
    - Keep titles short—ideally fewer than 10–12 words—and summarise the guide’s scope in one sentence.
        
    - Use the active voice and avoid gerunds (“planning,” “organizing”); choose verbs in imperative form.
        
    - Include numbers if the guide is broken into steps or tips; ensure the count is accurate and avoid combining numbers with trigger words.
        
    - Front‑load primary keywords (task, tool, subject) to maximise search visibility.
        
    - Remove unnecessary articles and filler words to streamline the title.
        
    - Use title case and proper nouns; mention versions or editions when relevant.
        
- **Hook and angle strategy**:
    
    - Highlight the desired outcome or benefit (“Save Money,” “Boost Energy,” “Protect Your Data”) in the title.
        
    - Address a common problem or pain point to show relevance (“Plan a Winter Trip on a Tight Budget”).
        
    - Use modifiers like “easy,” “quick,” or “step‑by‑step” sparingly to suggest accessibility without overselling.
        
    - Consider including timeframe or resource qualifiers (“in under an hour,” “using free tools”) to increase appeal.
        
    - Avoid gimmicks and clickbait; the promise should match the content’s depth and complexity.
        
    - Use negative phrasing when instructive (“Avoid These Mistakes When…”) only when the article focuses on pitfalls; avoid gratuitous negativity.
        
    - Ensure the value proposition is clear without oversimplifying or exaggerating the effort required.
        
- **Style, tone, and formatting rules**:
    
    - Instructional and authoritative; maintain clarity and professionalism.
        
    - Refrain from using colloquial language or humour that could undermine credibility.
        
    - Use concise phrasing; avoid unnecessary adjectives or adverbs.
        
    - Employ consistent syntax across guides to reinforce brand voice.
        
    - Avoid exclamation points, question marks and rhetorical devices; rely on the strength of the promise.
        
    - Respect diversity and inclusion by ensuring examples and scenarios are widely applicable.
        
    - Keep titles within the typical 60‑character SERP limit to avoid truncation.
        
- **Preferred words and phrases**:
    
    - build, create, plan, design, draft, craft, prepare, organise, manage
        
    - optimise, maximise, improve, simplify, enhance, elevate, refine
        
    - step‑by‑step, complete, guide, blueprint, checklist, tutorial, course
        
    - in X steps, on a budget, for beginners, without stress, with ease
        
    - effective, practical, simple, efficient, streamlined, foolproof
        
    - choose, select, compare, evaluate, troubleshoot, repair
        
    - save, invest, protect, grow, reduce, improve
        
    - quick, easy, fast, seamless (use judiciously)
        
- **Words and patterns to avoid**:
    
    - Starting titles with **“How to…”** or **“Everything you need to know…”**.
        
    - Using gerunds or weak verbs (**“planning,” “organising,” “getting”**) when stronger verbs exist.
        
    - Hyperbolic or promotional adjectives (**“ultimate,” “definitive,” “incredible,” “insane,”** or **“life‑changing”**).
        
    - Clickbait hooks (**“You’ll never guess,” “secret hacks,” “unbelievable tricks”**).
        
    - Combining trigger words and numbers in the same title (e.g., “Why 7 Steps to…”).
        
    - Non‑specific nouns (**“stuff,” “things,” “tips”**) without descriptors (replace with tasks, steps, or items).
        
    - Overly long titles that run on or include multiple clauses.
        
    - Buzzwords and jargon unfamiliar to the general reader (unless the guide is intended for specialists).
        
- **Final quality checklist**:
    
    - Does the title state the subject and action clearly without starting with “How to”?
        
    - Is it concise (≤10–12 words) and free of filler?
        
    - Are active verbs in imperative form used instead of gerunds?
        
    - Does it highlight the benefit or outcome of the guide?
        
    - Are numbers used appropriately to structure the steps or tips?
        
    - Are keywords front‑loaded and relevant to the task?
        
    - Does the title avoid hype, jargon and clickbait patterns?
        
    - Is the tone instructional and authoritative?
        
    - Is the title respectful and inclusive, avoiding assumptions about the reader’s knowledge or resources?
