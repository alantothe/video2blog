## Checklist

- **Purpose of titles:** Signal that the article is a practical, easy‑to‑follow list of steps or items, promising readers a comprehensive resource they can tick off as they go.
    
- **Audience mindset:** Readers are looking for a concise, actionable guide to complete a task or prepare for an event; they value clarity and completeness.
    
- **Title structure rules:**
    
    - Use a number if appropriate; listicles with numbers stand out in search results and grab attention.
        
    - Include the word “checklist,” “to‑do list,” or a similar term to signal format.
        
    - Start with a strong adjective or benefit (“Essential,” “Ultimate,” “Complete”) to convey value.
        
    - Mention the specific topic or context (e.g., “travel packing,” “product launch”) so users know what the list covers.
        
    - Keep the title under about 60–70 characters to remain scannable on search and social feeds.
        
    - Place the number toward the beginning along with the keyword when it feels natural.
        
    - Maintain parallel structure and avoid awkward phrasing; clarity over cleverness.
        
    - Use sentence case or title case consistently with the brand style.
        
- **Hook and angle strategy:**
    
    - Promise a benefit such as saving time, avoiding mistakes, or ensuring readiness.
        
    - Highlight what makes the list comprehensive (“Everything You Need,” “Don’t Forget These”) to assure completeness.
        
    - Use urgency or situational cues (“Before You Travel,” “For Your Next Job Interview”) to connect with immediate needs.
        
    - Emphasize ease and accessibility, suggesting the reader can print or tick items off.
        
    - Appeal to emotions by addressing common fears (“Avoid Last‑Minute Stress,” “Never Miss a Step Again”).
        
    - Avoid clickbait; deliver on what the title promises.
        
    - Align with search queries by mirroring how people ask for checklists.
        
- **Style, tone, and formatting rules:**
    
    - Clear, straightforward, and friendly; encourage action without lecturing.
        
    - Use active voice and present tense (“Pack,” “Prepare,” “Check”).
        
    - Avoid puns or humor that might obscure the purpose; focus on usability.
        
    - Keep punctuation simple (avoid multiple exclamation marks or question marks).
        
    - Capitalize key words; follow consistent formatting across titles.
        
    - Maintain inclusivity and avoid language that assumes only one type of reader.
        
    - Steer clear of sensational adjectives; focus on reliability and completeness.
        
- **Preferred words and phrases:**
    
    - “Checklist,” “To‑Do,” “Step‑by‑Step,” “Guide”
        
    - “Essential,” “Complete,” “Ultimate,” “Comprehensive”
        
    - “Must‑Have,” “Must‑Know,” “Key,” “Important”
        
    - “Before You [Verb],” “Things You Need,” “What to Pack”
        
    - “Prep,” “Ready,” “Plan,” “Organize”
        
    - “Don’t Forget,” “Everything You Need,” “A Quick Guide”
        
    - Numbers (e.g., “10,” “15,” “7”) when they add clarity
        
    - “Avoid,” “Prevent,” “Ensure”
        
    - “Easy,” “Simple,” “Quick”
        
- **Words and patterns to avoid:**
    
    - Clickbait phrases (“Crazy Hacks,” “Secret Tricks”) that overpromise
        
    - Negative or fearmongering language (“Disaster,” “Foolproof”) unless appropriate to context
        
    - Overly long numbers that overwhelm (e.g., “101 items” unless intentionally exhaustive)
        
    - Ambiguous abbreviations or industry jargon unfamiliar to the general reader
        
    - Slang or colloquialisms that may not translate across demographics
        
    - Redundant qualifiers (“Very Essential,” “Extremely Ultimate”)
        
    - Vague nouns (“Stuff,” “Things”) without context
        
    - Phrases that undercut professionalism (“Don’t be stupid,” “No‑brainers”)
        
    - All caps or multiple exclamation points
        
- **Final quality checklist:**
    
    - Does the title clearly identify itself as a checklist or list‑based guide?
        
    - Is the number (if used) appropriate and positioned naturally?
        
    - Have you included a strong descriptor and the specific subject of the list?
        
    - Is the title concise, within 60–70 characters, and free of filler words?
        
    - Does it promise a concrete benefit or outcome without clickbait?
        
    - Is the language clear, inclusive, and action‑oriented?
        
    - Does the title match the intent of likely search queries?
        
    - Have you avoided sensational or misleading wording?
        
    - Is the capitalization and punctuation consistent with editorial standards?
        
    - Would a reader instantly understand what they’ll gain from the article?
