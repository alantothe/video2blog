## Best Of

- **Purpose of titles (1–2 lines)**
    
    - Communicate that the article is a curated and authoritative ranking or roundup of top options within a category, timeframe or geography.
        
    - Convey transparency and neutrality by avoiding commercial bias and clearly reflecting the criteria used.
        
- **Audience mindset (1 line)**
    
    - Readers expect an impartial, well‑researched list to help them choose among the best options, whether for products, destinations, restaurants or experiences.
        
- **Title structure rules (5–8 bullet points)**
    
    - Begin with a superlative or numerical indicator (“10 Best…,” “Top Picks for…”), combined with the category and location or timeframe.
        
    - Specify the scope (e.g., “2026,” “Under $50,” “Family‑Friendly”) to manage expectations and help readers self‑select.
        
    - Include distinguishing criteria when relevant (e.g., “Editors’ Choice,” “Readers’ Picks,” “Sustainable”).
        
    - Keep titles concise (8–12 words) and in title case; avoid unnecessary adjectives or puns.
        
    - Use active voice and clear nouns; avoid ambiguous categories (“Best Things”) in favor of specifics (“Best Hikes,” “Best Vegan Restaurants”).
        
    - If ranking results from original research or awards, ensure the methodology is referenced within the article; reflect neutrality in the headline.
        
    - Place keywords early for SEO, but do not repeat them redundantly.
        
    - Do not imply exclusivity or completeness unless the article justifies it (“Our Complete List…” should deliver completeness).
        
- **Hook and angle strategy (5–8 bullet points)**
    
    - Emphasize what sets the list apart—unique criteria, expert judging, insider knowledge—to build trust and authority.
        
    - Use numbers to promise specificity; odd numbers often appeal to readers but ensure accuracy (“Top 9 Luxury Hotels”).
        
    - Highlight recency or relevance (“Best New Restaurants of 2026,” “Best Coffee Shops in Winter”).
        
    - Mention audience‑specific benefits when appropriate (“Best Kid‑Friendly Beaches”).
        
    - Avoid sensational claims or absolute superlatives (“Greatest of All Time”) that are subjective or unprovable.
        
    - Build curiosity by indicating diversity or hidden gems (“Best NYC Bars Beyond Times Square”) while ensuring the article delivers.
        
    - Clarify whether the ranking is based on professional reviews, customer ratings or data; this transparency fosters trust.
        
    - Do not tease with withheld information (“You Won’t Guess What’s #1”)—such gimmicks are clickbait.
        
- **Style, tone and formatting rules (5–8 bullet points)**
    
    - Adopt a confident, authoritative tone that reflects rigorous research rather than personal preference.
        
    - Follow AP style; ensure consistency in capitalization, punctuation and numbers.
        
    - Avoid commercial language (“Buy Now,” “Limited Offer”) in headlines; maintain editorial neutrality.
        
    - Do not overuse modifiers; let the quality of items speak through the description rather than hyperbolic adjectives.
        
    - Keep the headline free of opinionated adjectives unless clearly part of the editorial positioning (“Most Luxurious”).
        
    - If the list includes sponsored entries or affiliate links, clearly label them in the article and disclose relationships near the recommendations.
        
    - Avoid abbreviations or acronyms unfamiliar to the audience.
        
    - Create alternative headlines for social channels that fit character limits without losing essential information.
        
- **Preferred words and phrases (8–15 bullet points)**
    
    - “Best,” “Top,” “Top Picks,” “Top [Number]”
        
    - “Our Favorites,” “Editors’ Choice,” “Critics’ Picks”
        
    - “Most Popular,” “Highest‑Rated,” “Must‑Try,” “Can’t‑Miss”
        
    - “Guide to…,” “For [Year/Season],” “to Try Now”
        
    - “Under $[Amount],” “Affordable,” “Luxury,” “Family‑Friendly”
        
    - “New,” “Classic,” “Hidden Gems,” “Iconic”
        
    - “Where to Eat/Stay,” “What to See,” “Top Attractions”
        
    - “Award‑Winning,” “Editor‑Tested,” “Expert‑Recommended”
        
    - “City,” “Neighborhood,” “Region,” “Category”
        
    - “Sustainable,” “Eco‑Friendly,” “Women‑Owned” (when relevant)
        
- **Words and patterns to avoid (8–15 bullet points)**
    
    - Misleading superlatives (“World’s Greatest”) without supporting evidence.
        
    - Clickbait phrases (“You Won’t Believe,” “Shocking”).
        
    - Subjective adjectives (“Awesome,” “Coolest”) that lack clear criteria.
        
    - Promotional language (“Limited‑Time Offer,” “Shop Now”) that blurs editorial and advertising.
        
    - Ranking descriptors that imply bias (“Our Sponsors’ Picks”) unless clearly labeled.
        
    - Hidden numbers (e.g., “Top Restaurants Revealed”) rather than stating the number.
        
    - Overly broad terms (“Best Things to Do”) without context.
        
    - Insider jargon or acronyms.
        
    - Clichés like “Ultimate List” unless truly comprehensive.
        
- **Final quality checklist (6–10 bullet points)**
    
    - Does the title clearly state the scope, category and, if applicable, timeframe?
        
    - Have conflicts of interest been addressed (e.g., separation of editorial and advertising, neutral methodology)?
        
    - Do the items and ranking criteria deliver what the headline promises?
        
    - Is the headline free of sensationalism or unsupported claims?
        
    - Are SEO keywords used appropriately without stuffing or redundancy?
        
    - Does the tone align with the brand—authoritative, unbiased, trustworthy?
        
    - If affiliate links or sponsored spots appear, has the article prepared disclosures per FTC guidelines?
        
    - Has the headline been reviewed by editors, SEO specialists and, when relevant, legal/ethics advisors?
        
    - For lists based on data or surveys, is the methodology referenced in the article and signposted in the title if needed?
