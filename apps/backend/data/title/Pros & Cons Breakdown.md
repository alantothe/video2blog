## Pros & Cons Breakdown

- **Purpose of titles (1–2 lines)**
    
    Titles for pros & cons breakdowns should communicate that the article offers a balanced evaluation of the benefits and drawbacks of a product, service or decision. They help readers decide whether something is right for them.
    
- **Audience mindset (1 line)**
    
    Readers are weighing options and want a clear, impartial summary of advantages and disadvantages to inform their choice.
    
- **Title structure rules (5–8 bullet points)**
    
    - Clearly identify the subject and use “advantages and disadvantages,” “benefits and drawbacks,” or similar phrasing instead of “pros & cons” where possible.
        
    - Use a comparison (“X vs. Y”) when evaluating two options.
        
    - Keep the headline concise; include a colon to introduce further clarification if needed.
        
    - Use sentence case; capitalize the first word and proper nouns.
        
    - Avoid articles and forms of “to be” to save space and maintain punchiness.
        
    - Include a question when inviting the reader to decide (“Is X right for you?”) but ensure it hints at the evaluative nature of the piece.
        
    - When possible, specify the audience or context (“for beginners,” “for families”) to enhance relevance.
        
    - Limit length to around 12–15 words so the headline remains easy to scan.
        
- **Hook and angle strategy (5–8 bullet points)**
    
    - Use the “This vs. That” format to compare two alternatives and signal a pro/con structure.
        
    - Highlight the evaluative nature with phrases like “advantages and disadvantages” or “benefits and drawbacks.”
        
    - Pose a question that prompts readers to consider their own needs (“Is [product] worth it?”).
        
    - Emphasize neutrality by avoiding overly positive or negative words; let readers know they will receive a balanced assessment.
        
    - Tie the evaluation to current trends or consumer decisions (e.g., “in 2026”).
        
    - Use numbers if listing multiple factors (“5 pros and 5 cons of…”).
        
    - Incorporate data or research to build trust.
        
    - Mention outcomes or use cases to show practical implications (“what you need to know before buying”).
        
- **Style, tone, and formatting rules (5–8 bullet points)**
    
    - Maintain an objective, informative tone; avoid persuasive or sales language.
        
    - Use simple, clear words; readers should grasp the context instantly.
        
    - Stick to sentence case and avoid excessive capitalization or punctuation.
        
    - Include keywords that reflect the product or decision being evaluated for SEO.
        
    - Avoid jargon or technical terms; when necessary, use parenthetical explanations.
        
    - Stay away from hyperbolic superlatives; the headline should not imply a verdict (“best,” “worst”) but rather an exploration.
        
    - Use inclusive language and avoid insulting or assumptive phrases.
        
    - Keep verbs active (“weighing,” “assessing,” “evaluating”).
        
- **Preferred words and phrases (8–15 bullet points)**
    
    - “Advantages and disadvantages”
        
    - “Benefits and drawbacks”
        
    - “Pros and cons” (sparingly and only if appropriate)
        
    - “Is it worth it?”
        
    - “Worth considering”
        
    - “Is [product] right for you?”
        
    - “Comparison” / “Comparing”
        
    - “Evaluation” / “Breakdown”
        
    - “What you need to know”
        
    - “Factors to consider”
        
    - “Weighing up”
        
    - “Analysis”
        
    - “Versus” / “vs.”
        
    - “Cost vs. benefit”
        
    - “Considerations”
        
- **Words and patterns to avoid (8–15 bullet points)**
    
    - Overused clickbait (“Shocking truth,” “You won’t believe”).
        
    - Sensational adjectives (“amazing,” “disastrous”) that skew neutrality.
        
    - Vague or unclear subjects (“This product”) without specifying what it is.
        
    - Slang or colloquial terms (“crap,” “sucks”).
        
    - Ambiguous pronouns (“they,” “it”) without context.
        
    - Using “pros & cons” repetitively; vary with “advantages/disadvantages”.
        
    - Claims that imply a verdict (“best,” “worst,” “only choice”).
        
    - Excessive punctuation (e.g., multiple question marks or exclamation points).
        
    - Technical jargon without explanation.
        
    - Misleading comparative phrases (“X vs. Y: Which one sucks?”).
        
- **Final quality checklist (6–10 bullet points)**
    
    - Verify that the title clearly states the subject and implies a balanced evaluation.
        
    - Ensure the phrasing uses “advantages and disadvantages” or equivalent and avoids unnecessary articles.
        
    - Use sentence case and active wording.
        
    - Keep the headline concise and scan‑friendly (12–15 words max).
        
    - Avoid clickbait or sensational language; tone should be impartial.
        
    - Include relevant keywords without stuffing.
        
    - Confirm that the headline stands alone and makes sense across channels.
        
    - Check spelling and clarity of the subject being compared or evaluated.
        
    - Ensure inclusivity and neutrality, avoiding biased wording.
        
    - Consider whether the title reflects the actual content and promises a balanced breakdown.
