## Visa & Entry Guide

- **Purpose of titles:** Offer readers accurate, up‑to‑date information on visa requirements and entry procedures for specific destinations. The title should convey authority and completeness.
    
- **Audience mindset:** Travelers need reliable guidance to navigate bureaucratic processes; they prioritize clarity, legality and timeliness.
    
- **Title structure rules:**
    
    - Begin with the destination followed by key terms like “Visa Requirements,” “Entry Guide,” or “How to Apply for a Visa.”
        
    - Include the visa type if specific (tourist, work, student) and the year when requirements have changed.
        
    - Use “Step‑by‑Step” or “Everything You Need to Know” to promise thoroughness when justified.
        
    - Keep titles concise (70–90 characters) and front‑load keywords such as the country name and “Visa”.
        
    - Use numerals for years, fees or step counts; abbreviate months when mentioning deadlines.
        
    - Avoid starting with a verb; ensure there is a clear subject (“Brazil Visa Requirements for 2026”).
        
    - Use a colon to separate broader context from specific instruction if helpful (“India Entry Rules: A 2026 Visitor’s Guide”).
        
- **Hook and angle strategy:**
    
    - Emphasize clarity and completeness (“Everything You Need to Know”), but only when the article is comprehensive.
        
    - Highlight significant updates or changes (“Updated 2026 Requirements”) to signal freshness.
        
    - Mention special circumstances (e.g., “eVisa,” “Visa on Arrival,” “ETIAS”) to attract relevant searches.
        
    - Avoid sensational language; the appeal lies in thoroughness and reliability rather than excitement.
        
    - Promise practical benefits (“Avoid Delays,” “Smooth Entry”) to reassure readers.
        
    - If the article includes a checklist or documentation summary, reference it (“Documents, Fees & Tips”).
        
    - Consider audience segments (“For U.S. Travelers,” “For Backpackers”) only if the article tailors information accordingly.
        
- **Style, tone, and formatting rules:**
    
    - Adopt a formal, authoritative tone; avoid slang or casual language.
        
    - Use present tense and active verbs for clarity.
        
    - Follow downstyle capitalization and omit end punctuation.
        
    - Avoid unnecessary adjectives; stick to facts and plain language.
        
    - Do not use acronyms unless widely recognized (eTA, ESTA); otherwise, spell out on first reference.
        
    - Refrain from using clever wordplay or puns; clarity and accuracy are paramount.
        
- **Preferred words and phrases:**
    
    - “Visa Requirements” / “Visa Guide”
        
    - “Entry Rules” / “Entry Guide”
        
    - “How to Apply”
        
    - “Step‑by‑Step”
        
    - “Documents Needed” / “Required Documents”
        
    - “Fees” / “Costs”
        
    - “Processing Time”
        
    - “eVisa” / “Visa on Arrival” / “ETIAS”
        
    - “Application Process”
        
    - “Renewal” / “Extension”
        
    - “Tips” / “Advice”
        
    - “Eligibility” / “Criteria”
        
    - “Valid for [X] Days”
        
    - “Travelers from [Country/Region]”
        
- **Words and patterns to avoid:**
    
    - Buzzwords or hype (“Surprising,” “Secret,” “Hassle‑Free”) that misrepresent the bureaucratic nature of visas.
        
    - Clichés like “Hidden Gem,” “Must‑See” in a visa context.
        
    - Overpromising (“Guaranteed Approval,” “Instant Visa”) unless legally supported.
        
    - Vague descriptors (“Simple,” “Easy”) without context; visa processes can be complex.
        
    - Misused terms (“Mecca,” “Nestled,” “Bustling”) irrelevant to legal requirements.
        
    - Fear‑based hooks (“Don’t Get Denied!”) unless the article specifically addresses common pitfalls.
        
    - Second‑person imperatives (“You Must Apply Now”) that sound like marketing rather than guidance.
        
    - Inaccurate year references or outdated terms; ensure timeliness.
        
- **Final quality checklist:**
    
    - Does the title clearly state the country and the focus on visa or entry rules?
        
    - Is the headline concise and within ~90 characters, with key terms front‑loaded?
        
    - Does it avoid unnecessary articles, conjunctions and verbs, adhering to downstyle?
        
    - Are any dates or years included only when relevant and accurate?
        
    - Does the tone convey authority and clarity, avoiding clickbait or hype?
        
    - Have you used specific descriptors (eVisa, fees, documents) to signal comprehensive coverage?
        
    - Are acronyms limited to widely known ones and spelled out when needed?
        
    - Would someone unfamiliar with the process immediately understand what information the article provides?
        
    - Double‑check for spelling, capitalization and punctuation consistency.
