## Destination Guide

- **Purpose of titles:** Convey a comprehensive overview of a destination and its key experiences, encouraging readers to plan and discover. Titles should instantly signal that the piece is a travel guide with practical value and inspiration.
    
- **Audience mindset:** Readers are future travellers seeking trustworthy guidance on what to see, do, eat and experience in a specific place.
    
- **Title structure rules:**
    
    - Always lead with the destination name; include region or country for lesser‑known places.
        
    - Use concrete nouns and active verbs to summarise the guide’s scope (e.g., “Explore,” “Discover,” “Plan,” “Experience”).
        
    - Highlight the main angle or promise, such as “Top Attractions,” “Ultimate Itinerary,” or “Hidden Gems.”
        
    - Include numeric hooks where appropriate (e.g., “10 Best Things to Do…”), but avoid using numbers for the sake of clickbait.
        
    - Keep titles under ~60–65 characters to ensure they display fully in search results.
        
    - Use title case (capitalising main words); omit unnecessary articles and punctuation per headline style conventions.
        
    - Include timeframe or season only when it materially helps planning (“Winter in…,” “2026 Guide”).
        
    - Do not promise exclusivity or secrets—titles should accurately represent the guide’s content.
        
- **Hook and angle strategy:**
    
    - Focus on what makes the destination unique (culture, cuisine, landscapes, festivals) rather than generic travel clichés.
        
    - Offer value‑oriented hooks: “Essential Tips,” “Local Favourites,” or “Family‑Friendly Highlights.”
        
    - Use sensory language sparingly to evoke atmosphere without overselling (e.g., “savour street food,” “wander ancient alleyways”).
        
    - Cater to specific traveller types when relevant (“Budget Traveller’s Guide,” “Luxury Stays,” “Solo Adventure”).
        
    - Highlight any timely or trending elements such as new attractions or reopened sites.
        
    - Emphasise actionable insights (“How to get around,” “Where to stay”) rather than broad inspiration alone.
        
    - Avoid hyperbolic adjectives (“mind‑blowing,” “insane”) that reduce credibility.
        
- **Style, tone and formatting rules:**
    
    - Maintain an authoritative yet approachable tone; aim for clarity and trustworthiness.
        
    - Write in the present tense and use strong verbs to create immediacy.
        
    - Steer clear of sensationalism or clickbait; never misrepresent the article’s scope or promise.
        
    - Optimise for search by naturally incorporating relevant keywords without stuffing.
        
    - Use punctuation sparingly; avoid exclamation marks and rhetorical questions.
        
    - When referring to lists, prefer “Best” or “Top” rather than “Ultimate” unless the content truly covers all aspects.
        
    - Keep language inclusive and accessible; avoid jargon or colloquialisms that may confuse readers.
        
- **Preferred words and phrases:**
    
    - “Complete guide,” “Essential guide,” “Ultimate itinerary,” “Top [number] attractions,” “Things to do,” “Must‑see,” “Hidden gems,” “Local favourites,” “Where to stay,” “What to eat,” “Travel tips,” “Family friendly,” “Budget,” “Luxury,” “Cultural highlights,” “Nature escapes,” “Historic sites,” “Festival calendar.”
        
- **Words and patterns to avoid:**
    
    - Clickbait phrases (“You won’t believe,” “Secret hack,” “Insanely cheap,” “Shocking reason”).
        
    - Sensational adjectives (“Crazy,” “Epic,” “Insane,” “Killer,” “Mind‑blowing”).
        
    - Negative imperatives (“Never visit,” “Avoid at all costs”) unless clearly justified in the content.
        
    - Ambiguous hooks (“Something special,” “Unexpected delight”) that do not convey clear value.
        
    - Over‑promising or misleading superlatives (“#1 destination in the world,” “Best ever”).
        
    - Exaggerated emotional appeals (“Fall in love with…” unless the piece genuinely focuses on romance or honeymoon travel).
        
    - Slang, abbreviations or acronyms unfamiliar to a general readership.
        
- **Final quality checklist:**
    
    - Does the title accurately summarise the destination guide’s focus without exaggeration?
        
    - Is the destination clearly named and easy to identify?
        
    - Are strong, specific verbs used instead of vague descriptors?
        
    - Is the length appropriate for search display (≤65 characters)?
        
    - Have you avoided clickbait and sensationalism while still offering a compelling hook?
        
    - Are keywords naturally integrated for SEO without stuffing?
        
    - Does the tone convey authority and helpfulness?
        
    - Have you used correct capitalisation and omitted unnecessary articles per headline style rules?
