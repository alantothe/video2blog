## Resource List

### Purpose of titles

Titles for resource lists should immediately convey that the article contains a curated set of useful items and why the reader should care. They must promise comprehensiveness and relevance without overstating the benefits.

### Audience mindset

Readers are scanning for specific resources and expect quick, trustworthy recommendations that save them time and effort.

### Title structure rules

- Start with a quantifier or descriptor (often a number) to set expectations; research shows headings with numerals attract attention and are more scannable.
    
- Include the subject and context (topic, location or category) so readers immediately know what resources are covered.
    
- Avoid generic labels; make titles independently meaningful and descriptive.
    
- Keep within roughly 11 words or 65 characters to optimise visibility and sharing.
    
- Use strong verbs or adjectives that convey value and usefulness.
    
- Employ present tense and active voice; omit articles (a, an, the) to save space and maintain punch.
    
- Sequence elements logically: quantity → descriptor → topic → qualifier (e.g., audience or edition).
    
- Add a timeframe when the list is time‑sensitive (seasonal or annual editions).
    

### Hook and angle strategy

- Emphasise completeness and usefulness; choose words like “best,” “essential,” or “must‑have” when appropriate.
    
- Highlight a unique angle (e.g., budget‑friendly, eco‑friendly, expert‑selected) to differentiate the list.
    
- Communicate a clear benefit, such as saving time or money.
    
- Use numbers to create structure and curiosity; lists featuring single‑digit numbers or ten tend to perform well.
    
- Prioritise clarity over cleverness—readers should understand the value instantly.
    
- Where relevant, mention the authoritative source or expertise behind the list.
    
- Avoid clickbait; ensure the headline accurately reflects the content.
    
- When location matters, include the place to enhance relevance and searchability.
    

### Style, tone, and formatting rules

- Adopt a professional yet approachable tone that conveys trust and helpfulness.
    
- Remain neutral and informative; avoid emotional or sensational language.
    
- Use title‑case capitalization, adhering to house style.
    
- Limit punctuation; a colon or dash can separate clauses if needed.
    
- Keep the title scannable and descriptive; avoid filler words.
    
- Use numerals rather than spelled‑out numbers.
    
- Avoid abbreviations or jargon unless widely understood; define any necessary acronym.
    
- Maintain consistency with the publication’s overall voice.

### Words and patterns to avoid

- Travel clichés like “hidden gem,” “must‑see,” “breathtaking,” “land of contrasts,” and “place that time forgot”.
    
- Overpromising phrases such as “life‑changing” or “ultimate hack” unless legitimately warranted.
    
- Misleading clickbait expressions like “you won’t believe,” “shocking,” or “unbelievable”.
    
- Vague descriptors like “various,” “many” or “numerous” without specifics.
    
- Generic labels such as “Information about…” or “Things to know…” that carry no value.
    
- Passive voice or past tense constructions.
    
- Unnecessary articles (the, a, an) in the headline.
    
- Complex jargon or unexplained acronyms.
    
- Emotional or fear‑based words unrelated to the content.
    
- Overused marketing phrases like “all you need to know” if the piece is not exhaustive.
    
- Words implying universal interest (“must‑see,” “everyone should”).
    
- Statements that could mislead or create legal risk (e.g., “guaranteed,” “proven”) without evidence.

- Does it highlight a unique angle or clear benefit?
    
- Is it free of clichés and generic phrases?
    
- Is the tone professional and authoritative?
    
- Does it follow style rules (capitalization, punctuation, active voice)?
    
- Would it attract search interest and social engagement?
    
- Can any words be removed for greater clarity or brevity?
