## Interview

- **Purpose of titles:** Capture the essence of the conversation by highlighting the interviewee and the main takeaway, guiding readers toward the insights shared.
    
- **Audience mindset:** Readers are curious about the person being interviewed and expect to learn from their experiences, viewpoints or expertise.
    
- **Title structure rules:**
    
    - Include the interviewee’s name or clearly identify their role (e.g., “Chef [Name] on Sustainable Cooking”).
        
    - State the core topic or insight gained from the conversation; use a colon or dash to separate subject from theme.
        
    - Keep titles succinct (about 8–12 words) while conveying the promise of the discussion.
        
    - Use present tense and active verbs like “discusses,” “reveals,” or “shares.”
        
    - Place the most important keyword or hook early to improve SEO and reader appeal.
        
    - Avoid using quotes out of context; paraphrase key ideas unless a short, impactful quote fits the space.
        
    - Prepare shorter variants for social media or newsletters, retaining the main hook.
        
- **Hook and angle strategy:**
    
    - Emphasise unique insights, expertise or experiences that make the interview compelling (“Lessons on resilience from Olympic medalist [Name]”).
        
    - Highlight relevance to current events or trends when applicable.
        
    - Use verbs that convey disclosure or reflection—“reveals,” “breaks down,” “explores,” “reflects on.”
        
    - Consider a concise quote from the interviewee as a hook only if it encapsulates the theme and is not misleading.
        
    - Avoid sensationalised hooks; ensure the title reflects the real substance of the interview.
        
    - When multiple interviewees or topics are involved, focus on the most newsworthy angle.
        
- **Style, tone and formatting rules:**
    
    - Maintain respect and authenticity; do not misrepresent or trivialise the subject.
        
    - Use clear, plain language that matches your audience’s level of knowledge; avoid industry jargon.
        
    - Be accurate with names, titles and affiliations; double‑check spelling.
        
    - Follow your publication’s capitalisation style consistently.
        
    - Avoid humour or puns that could mischaracterise the interviewee’s tone.
        
    - Use colon or em dash to separate the interviewee from the topic rather than parentheses or quotes.
        
- **Preferred words and phrases:**
    
    - “In Conversation with,” “Interview,” “Q&A,” “What [Name] Thinks About,” “[Name] on,” “Lessons from,” “[Name] Reveals,” “Insights from,” “Behind the Scenes with,” “Perspectives on,” “Discusses,” “Reflects on,” “Exploring,” “Breaking Down.”
        
- **Words and patterns to avoid:**
    
    - Misleading quotes or incomplete phrases that misrepresent the interviewee.
        
    - Sensationalist phrases like “You won’t believe,” “Jaw‑dropping,” or “Unbelievable confession.”
        
    - Ambiguous questions or puns unrelated to the interview’s subject.
        
    - Obscure references or jokes that require insider knowledge to understand.
        
    - Using only the person’s name without context; always signal the topic or angle.
        
    - Overly long titles or subtitles that dilute the focus.
        
    - Excessive punctuation (exclamation marks, ellipses).
        
- **Final quality checklist:**
    
    - Does the title clearly identify the interviewee and the central theme?
        
    - Have you used an active verb that conveys disclosure or discussion?
        
    - Is the title truthful and free from sensationalism or misquoting?
        
    - Is it concise yet descriptive enough to stand alone?
        
    - Are key keywords front‑loaded for SEO and relevance?
        
    - Have you checked the spelling of names and titles?
        
    - Is there an alternative, shorter version for social or mobile platforms?
        
    - Does the tone align with the interviewee’s persona and the publication’s brand?
        
    - Have you considered potential legal or brand risks and obtained necessary approvals?
