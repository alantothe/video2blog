## Buyer’s Guide

- **Purpose of titles (1–2 lines)**
    
    - Communicate that the article helps readers make informed purchasing decisions by comparing options, explaining features and providing expert recommendations.
        
    - Establish trust through transparency about methodology and any commercial relationships, ensuring the guide serves the reader rather than sales.
        
- **Audience mindset (1 line)**
    
    - Readers are researching products or services, seeking unbiased insights, value considerations and potential pitfalls before making a purchase.
        
- **Title structure rules (5–8 bullet points)**
    
    - Lead with the product category or problem to be solved (“Best Noise‑Cancelling Headphones,” “Electric Car Buyer’s Guide”), followed by context such as year or target user (“2026,” “for Commuters”).
        
    - If the guide is part of a regular series (“Buyer’s Guide”), include that phrase at the end or within parentheses to signal format.
        
    - Use numerals when the guide features specific picks (“Top 7”) but only if the article has a discrete list; otherwise opt for “Buyer’s Guide” without a number.
        
    - Highlight important differentiators (“Affordable,” “Premium,” “Eco‑Friendly”) only when the article specifically compares based on those attributes.
        
    - Keep titles between 8–14 words; avoid extraneous adjectives or industry jargon.
        
    - Include the publication year when products evolve rapidly (technology, vehicles) to emphasise currency.
        
    - Adhere to AP style for capitalization and abbreviation; avoid truncated brand names or model codes that readers may not recognize.
        
    - For series with affiliate links, the headline should not include promotional calls-to-action (“Buy Now”) but may use objective descriptors (“Best Budget,” “Top Performance”).
        
- **Hook and angle strategy (5–8 bullet points)**
    
    - Emphasize the problem the guide solves (“Quietest Headphones for Open Offices”) to resonate with readers’ needs.
        
    - Signal comprehensiveness or expertise (“Editor‑Tested Guide to…,” “Everything You Need to Know About…”) when the article offers deep analysis.
        
    - Use audience qualifiers to help readers self‑select (“for Beginners,” “for Power Users,” “for Families”).
        
    - Highlight unique angles like sustainability, ethical production or design aesthetics to differentiate from generic buyer guides.
        
    - Avoid urgency phrases (“Don’t Wait,” “Limited Offer”) that cross into advertising and undermine editorial independence.
        
    - Balance SEO keywords (product name, category) with readability; avoid repeating keywords in unnatural ways.
        
    - Do not tease secret deals or undisclosed prices; be transparent about what the article includes.
        
    - Where appropriate, mention whether products were tested in-house or curated from research; transparency builds trust.
        
- **Style, tone and formatting rules (5–8 bullet points)**
    
    - Adopt an objective, informative tone; avoid overt sales language or personal bias.
        
    - Follow AP style guidelines for capitalization, punctuation and numbers.
        
    - Avoid subjective descriptors (“awesome,” “must‑have”) that convey opinion rather than fact.
        
    - Use consistent naming conventions for product categories and models; verify correct spellings and trademarks.
        
    - Ensure the headline does not imply a single definitive choice unless the article designates a winner and justifies it.
        
    - Use “versus” or “vs.” when comparing two products, but avoid stacking too many comparisons into one headline.
        
    - For affiliate content, ensure the article clearly discloses material connections near each recommendation and uses plain language.
        
    - Collaborate with legal or compliance teams when necessary to ensure compliance with advertising and disclosure regulations.
        
- **Preferred words and phrases (8–15 bullet points)**
    
    - “Buyer’s Guide,” “Shopping Guide,” “Ultimate Guide,” “Complete Guide”
        
    - “Best,” “Top,” “Recommended,” “Our Picks”
        
    - “How to Choose,” “What to Look For,” “Features Explained”
        
    - “Affordable,” “Budget,” “Premium,” “Entry‑Level,” “Mid‑Range,” “Flagship”
        
    - “Editor‑Tested,” “Expert‑Reviewed,” “Hands‑On,” “In‑Depth”
        
    - “For [Year/Season],” “2026 Edition,” “Latest Models”
        
    - “Comparing,” “Comparison,” “Versus,” “vs.”
        
    - “Pros and Cons,” “Strengths and Weaknesses”
        
    - “Top [Number],” “Best Overall,” “Best Value,” “Best for [Use Case]”
        
    - “Eco‑Friendly,” “Sustainable,” “Ethical,” “Fair Trade”
        
    - “Warranty,” “Battery Life,” “Performance,” “Durability”
        
    - “Where to Buy,” “Price,” “Deals” (when factual)
        
    - “User Reviews,” “Customer Feedback,” “Ratings”
        
    - “Specifications,” “Specs,” “Features”
        
- **Words and patterns to avoid (8–15 bullet points)**
    
    - Promotional phrases (“Buy Now,” “Limited Time Offer,” “Act Fast”) that belong in ads, not editorial titles.
        
    - Subjective hype (“Unbelievable,” “Game‑Changer”) unless backed by evidence.
        
    - Vague or generic titles (“All About Cameras”) that don’t promise value.
        
    - Overuse of exclamation points or question marks (“Which is Best?”).
        
    - Misleading comparisons (“Better Than Brand X”) without context.
        
    - Hidden affiliations or undisclosed sponsorship signals; transparency is critical.
        
    - Abbreviations or model numbers that most readers won’t recognize without explanation.
        
    - Phrases implying scarcity or fear of missing out (FOMO).
        
    - Superlatives without evidence (“Perfect,” “Flawless”).
        
    - Terms like “One Weird Trick” or “Life Hack” that signal clickbait.
        
- **Final quality checklist (6–10 bullet points)**
    
    - Does the title clearly state the product category, scope and target audience or year?
        
    - Is the tone neutral and informative, free from promotional language?
        
    - Are any implied rankings or superlatives supported by methodology disclosed in the article?
        
    - Have material connections or affiliate relationships been disclosed in a clear, conspicuous location near recommendations?
        
    - Does the headline follow AP style rules on capitalization and abbreviations?
        
    - Are there no clichés, clickbait terms or vague promises?
        
    - Is the length appropriate for SEO and social sharing (8–14 words)?
        
    - Has the title been reviewed by editors, SEO specialists and compliance/legal teams as needed?
        
    - Will readers immediately know the value proposition of the guide from the title alone?
        
    - Is there a plan to update the title when products or prices change, ensuring ongoing accuracy and relevance?
