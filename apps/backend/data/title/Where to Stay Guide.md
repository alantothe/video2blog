## Where to Stay Guide

- **Purpose of titles:** Direct readers to the best areas and accommodations within a destination by outlining neighborhoods, lodging types and budgets. The title should promise practical, organized choices.
    
- **Audience mindset:** Travelers are ready to book accommodations and need trustworthy, organized advice on where to stay based on their preferences and budget.
    
- **Title structure rules:**
    
    - Begin with “Where to Stay in [Destination]” or “Best Areas to Stay in…” to clearly state the topic.
        
    - Follow with a descriptor of what’s covered (“Neighborhoods & Hotels,” “Areas for Every Budget”) to add specificity.
        
    - Incorporate categories (e.g., “Family, Budget & Luxury”) when the article segments recommendations; use commas or a colon for separation.
        
    - Keep the headline within 70–90 characters and roughly eight to ten words for readability.
        
    - Front‑load the destination and key terms (“Stay,” “Best Areas”) for SEO.
        
    - Use numerals to denote the number of areas or hotels when appropriate (e.g., “10 Best Neighborhoods…”).
        
    - Avoid starting with a verb; provide a clear subject and avoid unnecessary articles.
        
- **Hook and angle strategy:**
    
    - Highlight the variety of options offered (“For Every Budget,” “For Couples, Families & Solo Travelers”) to broaden appeal.
        
    - Emphasize benefits such as proximity (“Near Beaches,” “Close to Attractions”) or experience (“Historic Districts,” “Vibrant Nightlife”).
        
    - If the article compares neighborhoods, hint at the criteria (“Safety, Price & Culture”).
        
    - Use “Guide” or “Breakdown” to signal organized, comprehensive content.
        
    - Avoid making promises you can’t deliver (e.g., “Absolute Cheapest Places”) unless supported by data.
        
    - Mention the year when updates to the accommodation scene are significant.
        
- **Style, tone, and formatting rules:**
    
    - Use a clear, informative tone that balances impartiality with helpful descriptors.
        
    - Write in present tense and use active constructions.
        
    - Follow downstyle capitalization; omit end punctuation.
        
    - Avoid flowery adjectives; instead, use specific qualifiers (“central,” “quiet,” “budget‑friendly”).
        
    - Keep language inclusive, considering different types of travelers.
        
    - Use commas instead of conjunctions to shorten lists and improve readability.
        
- **Preferred words and phrases:**
    
    - “Where to Stay”
        
    - “Best Areas” / “Top Neighborhoods”
        
    - “Accommodation Guide”
        
    - “Neighborhoods & Hotels”
        
    - “For Every Budget” / “Budget to Luxury”
        
    - “Family‑Friendly” / “Couples” / “Solo Travelers”
        
    - “Downtown” / “Historic District” / “Beachfront” / “Near the Airport”
        
    - “Area Breakdown” / “Neighborhood Guide”
        
    - “Hotels, Hostels & Rentals”
        
    - “Close to [Landmark]”
        
    - “Safety” / “Convenience”
        
    - “Updated [Year]”
        
    - “Boutique” / “Luxury” / “Budget”
        
    - “Stay Like a Local”
        
- **Words and patterns to avoid:**
    
    - Clichés such as “Hidden Gem Neighborhoods,” “Best‑Kept Secret Places”.
        
    - Hyperbole (“Hottest,” “Coolest,” “Ultimate”) without clear criteria.
        
    - Generic adjectives like “Lovely,” “Charming,” “Cozy,” “Quaint” unless supported by specific details.
        
    - Misused or outdated terms (“Hipster,” “Mecca,” “Bustling”).
        
    - Clickbait phrases (“You Won’t Believe,” “Must Stay Here Before It’s Gone”).
        
    - Excessive abbreviations or local nicknames that readers might not recognize.
        
    - Broad claims (“Best in the World”) that cannot be substantiated.
        
    - Overly long lists of qualifiers that clutter the headline.
        
- **Final quality checklist:**
    
    - Does the title clearly state that it covers accommodation or areas within a specific destination?
        
    - Are the key terms and destination front‑loaded for clarity and SEO?
        
    - Is the headline concise and free of unnecessary articles and conjunctions?
        
    - Does it accurately reflect the breadth of the guide (neighborhoods, hotels, budgets) without exaggeration?
        
    - Have you avoided clichés, hyperbolic adjectives and clickbait words?
        
    - Is the tone informative and inclusive, appealing to various traveler types?
        
    - Are numerals and categories used judiciously to organize information?
        
    - Is punctuation minimal and capitalization consistent with downstyle?
        
    - Would someone planning lodging immediately know the article offers practical accommodation guidance?
