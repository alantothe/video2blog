## Cultural Etiquette Guide

- **Purpose of titles:** Communicate that the article will provide respectful, culturally sensitive guidance for interacting with a specific community or region, helping readers avoid faux pas and build meaningful connections.
    
- **Audience mindset:** Travelers, expatriates, or businesspeople seeking to understand and respect local customs; they value authenticity and want to avoid causing offense.
    
- **Title structure rules:**
    
    - Begin with the country, region, or cultural group followed by “Cultural Etiquette Guide” or a similar phrase (e.g., “Etiquette Dos and Don’ts”).
        
    - Use a subtitle or secondary phrase to highlight the focus on respect, customs, or travel tips (“Respectful Travel in [Place]”).
        
    - Keep the title under about 70 characters to ensure full display in search results.
        
    - Use descriptive adjectives such as “Essential,” “Respectful,” “Comprehensive,” or “Insider” to indicate value.
        
    - Avoid exoticizing language; present the culture neutrally and respectfully.
        
    - Include the intended audience if helpful (“for First‑Time Visitors,” “for Business Travelers”).
        
    - Capitalize proper nouns and follow consistent punctuation.
        
    - Use words like “Guide,” “Dos and Don’ts,” or “How to” to signal instructional content.
        
- **Hook and angle strategy:**
    
    - Emphasize respect and cultural sensitivity as the key benefit (“Respectful Travel,” “Navigating [Culture] Customs”).
        
    - Highlight specific areas covered (greetings, dining, dress) to attract curious readers.
        
    - Convey that following the guide will enhance authenticity and connection.
        
    - Use inviting language that suggests the reader will gain confidence and avoid embarrassment.
        
    - If the destination has unique customs, hint at them without stereotyping.
        
    - Incorporate a positive framing (“Enrich Your Experience,” “Build Bridges”) rather than focusing on avoiding mistakes.
        
    - Avoid sensationalism; instead, offer a promise of learning and mutual respect.
        
- **Style, tone, and formatting rules:**
    
    - Respectful, empathetic, and authoritative; avoid paternalistic or judgmental language.
        
    - Use inclusive words that speak to a broad audience (travellers, visitors, newcomers).
        
    - Prefer gentle guidance over strict commands; replace “must” with “should” or “it’s customary.”
        
    - Avoid clichés or stereotypes; use neutral descriptors.
        
    - Maintain clarity and warmth; tone should encourage curiosity and cultural appreciation.
        
    - Consistent capitalization of cultural terms and locations.
        
    - Steer clear of humor or slang that could be misinterpreted across cultures.
        
- **Preferred words and phrases:**
    
    - “Cultural etiquette,” “dos and don’ts,” “customs,” “traditions”
        
    - “Respectful travel,” “mindful,” “courtesy,” “manners”
        
    - “Guide,” “What to know,” “How to,” “Navigating [culture]”
        
    - “Greet,” “Dress,” “Dine,” “Interact,” “Local insights”
        
    - “Essentials,” “Tips,” “Advice,” “Basics”
        
    - “Visitors,” “Travelers,” “Business etiquette”
        
    - “Understanding,” “Appreciating,” “Connecting”
        
    - “Do’s and Don’ts,” “Rules of [culture] manners,” “What not to do”
        
- **Words and patterns to avoid:**
    
    - Sensational adjectives (“bizarre,” “strange,” “weird,” “crazy”) that exoticize the culture
        
    - Stereotypes or generalizations (“all [people] are…”)
        
    - Diminutive or infantilizing terms (“locals,” “natives”) without context
        
    - Fear‑based phrasing (“avoid offending,” “don’t get in trouble”) unless necessary
        
    - Phrases implying superiority (“teach them how to behave,” “civilize”)
        
    - Clickbait or judgmental language (“you won’t believe,” “shocking etiquette”)
        
    - Overly academic jargon that alienates general readers
        
    - Humor or puns that could be culturally insensitive
        
    - Long lists of countries or practices that clutter the title
        
- **Final quality checklist:**
    
    - Does the title clearly identify the culture or region and state it’s an etiquette guide?
        
    - Is the tone respectful, free of stereotypes and sensationalism?
        
    - Is the title concise (under 70 characters) and informative?
        
    - Have you included a subtitle or phrase that highlights respect or key customs?
        
    - Does the language invite readers to learn and connect rather than avoid mistakes?
        
    - Are proper nouns and cultural terms capitalized correctly?
        
    - Have you steered clear of clickbait, exoticizing, or judgmental wording?
        
    - Does the title appeal to the intended audience (travelers, business people, etc.)?
        
    - Would someone unfamiliar with the culture feel welcomed rather than wary?
