## Budget Travel Guide

- **Purpose of titles (1–2 lines)**
    
    - Signal that the article offers practical, money‑saving tips for traveling to a destination or type of trip without sacrificing quality or experience.
        
    - Attract value‑conscious readers who want to explore affordably while maintaining transparency about costs.
        
- **Audience mindset (1 line)**
    
    - Readers are cost‑sensitive travellers seeking trustworthy advice on how to maximize experience while minimizing expenses.
        
- **Title structure rules (5–8 bullet points)**
    
    - Start with keywords that combine destination or type (“Paris,” “Island Hopping,” “Road Trip”) with budget focus (“on $50 a Day,” “For Under $500”).
        
    - Mention whether the guide covers accommodations, food, activities or overall trip planning (“Budget Guide to Eating Well in Tokyo”).
        
    - Use specific numbers or ranges to set expectations (“7 Ways to See Rome for Less Than $1,000”).
        
    - Keep titles concise and in title case; avoid filler words and maintain clarity.
        
    - If the article targets a particular audience (students, families, solo travellers), include that identifier.
        
    - Avoid ambiguous terms like “cheap” in favor of “affordable,” “budget‑friendly,” “low‑cost,” which sound more positive and less dismissive.
        
    - Ensure numbers and savings claims are accurate and can be substantiated in the article.
        
    - Place the main keywords at the beginning to improve search visibility.
        
- **Hook and angle strategy (5–8 bullet points)**
    
    - Promise tangible benefits such as “Save Money,” “Spend Less,” “Free Attractions,” while providing enough context to avoid clickbait.
        
    - Highlight unique angles like shoulder‑season travel, alternative lodging, or local markets to differentiate from generic cost‑saving tips.
        
    - Use numbers to structure the promise (“10 Free Museums in London”) and deliver on that count.
        
    - Emphasize authenticity—affordable does not mean inferior; communicate that budget travel can be rich in experience.
        
    - When a destination is expensive by reputation, stress insider knowledge (“How to Experience Iceland on a Budget”).
        
    - Avoid fear‑based or shaming language; focus on empowerment and smart planning rather than deprivation.
        
    - If a discount, deal or promotion is included, ensure it is factually correct and not time‑expired; avoid making price the sole hook.
        
    - Clarify whether prices are per person, per day, or total trip to avoid misunderstanding.
        
- **Style, tone and formatting rules (5–8 bullet points)**
    
    - Use a friendly, resourceful tone that emphasizes possibility and practicality.
        
    - Follow AP style and maintain clarity, brevity and accuracy.
        
    - Avoid superlatives and subjective adjectives (“cheapest ever”) unless supported by data.
        
    - Use active voice; avoid vague qualifiers like “might,” “maybe,” unless uncertainty is integral to the story.
        
    - Avoid abbreviations not universally understood; spell out currency abbreviations (USD) unless globally recognized.
        
    - Stay transparent—if values are approximate or based on certain assumptions, reflect that within the article and avoid overstating in the headline.
        
    - Do not trivialize financial constraints or stereotype budget travellers; maintain an inclusive and respectful tone.
        
    - Test alternative headlines for different distribution channels and adjust accordingly.
        
- **Preferred words and phrases (8–15 bullet points)**
    
    - “Budget‑Friendly,” “Affordable,” “Low‑Cost,” “Cost‑Effective”
        
    - “On $[Amount] a Day,” “Under $[Amount],” “For [Amount] or Less”
        
    - “Save Money,” “Spend Less,” “Stretch Your Dollar”
        
    - “Free,” “Cheap Eats,” “Affordable Stays,” “Economy”
        
    - “Frugal,” “Value‑Driven,” “Money‑Saving Tips,” “Wallet‑Friendly”
        
    - “DIY,” “Self‑Guided,” “Thrifty,” “Budget Travel”
        
    - “Smart,” “Insider,” “Hidden Gems on a Budget”
        
    - “Deals,” “Discounts,” “Special Offers” (if accurate)
        
    - “Backpacker,” “Shoestring,” “Students,” “Families”
        
    - Seasonal references (“Off‑Season,” “Shoulder Season,” “Off‑Peak”)
        
    - “Guide,” “Plan,” “Itinerary”
        
- **Words and patterns to avoid (8–15 bullet points)**
    
    - “Cheap” used pejoratively; opt for positive terms like “affordable” or “value.”
        
    - “Free” when there are hidden costs or conditions.
        
    - Over‑promising (“Travel Europe for Free”) or implying unrealistic savings.
        
    - Gimmicky phrases (“Pay Nothing,” “Hack Your Vacation”) that suggest shortcuts or exploitation.
        
    - Negative stereotypes (“For Broke Students”) or condescending language.
        
    - Broad statements (“Best Way to See the World”) lacking scope or accuracy.
        
    - Vague quantifiers (“Lots of Ways,” “Tons of Deals”) that don’t set expectations.
        
    - Clickbait buzzwords (“Secret,” “Shocking”).
        
    - All caps, exclamation points or emotive emojis (unsuitable for professional publications).
        
    - Jargon or abbreviations not commonly understood by an international audience.
        
- **Final quality checklist (6–10 bullet points)**
    
    - Does the title clearly convey that the guide is budget‑focused and name the destination or theme?
        
    - Are monetary claims specific, accurate and backed up in the article?
        
    - Is the tone empowering rather than shaming or gimmicky?
        
    - Does the headline follow AP style and avoid abbreviations?
        
    - Is the headline free from clichés and clickbait terms?
        
    - Are the primary keywords placed early for SEO without sacrificing clarity?
        
    - Has the headline been reviewed for cultural sensitivity and inclusivity?
        
    - If deals or affiliate products are mentioned, does the article include clear and conspicuous disclosures per FTC guidelines?
        
    - Has the headline been tested across channels and adjusted as needed?
