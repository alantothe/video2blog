## Itinerary Article

- **Purpose of titles:** Offer a clear promise of a structured travel plan, specifying the destination, duration and experience to help readers plan or dream about a trip.
    
- **Audience mindset:** Readers seek practical, organised guidance and aspirational experiences; they expect day‑by‑day structure and highlights of what they will see or do.
    
- **Title structure rules:**
    
    - Begin with the number of days or length of the trip (use digits), followed by the destination and theme (e.g., “7‑Day Enchanting Japan Itinerary”).
        
    - Include descriptive adjectives that set the mood (e.g., “Epic,” “Family‑Friendly,” “Gourmet”).
        
    - Use a colon or dash to add a brief tagline or highlight (“… – From Ancient Temples to Modern Skylines”).
        
    - Front‑load the destination and primary keywords for SEO purposes.
        
    - Keep titles under 12–15 words to maintain clarity and avoid truncation.
        
    - Ensure the title can stand alone and accurately reflect the itinerary’s scope and style.
        
    - Maintain consistent formatting across similar articles (e.g., always specify the number of days at the start).
        
- **Hook and angle strategy:**
    
    - Emphasise unique experiences, hidden gems or must‑see highlights (“Discover Volcanoes and Waterfalls on this Costa Rica Adventure”).
        
    - Highlight the type of traveller or theme (e.g., “Food Lover’s Tour,” “Budget‑Friendly Route,” “Luxury Honeymoon”).
        
    - Mention seasonal or special events if relevant (“Cherry Blossom Journey through Kyoto”).
        
    - Use vivid sensory language to evoke anticipation without exaggeration.
        
    - Avoid generic descriptions; focus on what makes the itinerary special.
        
    - Align the angle with the readers’ search intent and travel preferences (cultural, adventure, relaxation).
        
- **Style, tone and formatting rules:**
    
    - Be inspiring yet informative; combine aspirational language with practical clarity.
        
    - Use active voice and present tense (“Experience,” “Explore,” “Discover”).
        
    - Avoid unnecessary hype or superlatives that promise more than the itinerary delivers.
        
    - Follow consistent capitalisation (title case or sentence case) and avoid ALL CAPS.
        
    - Keep the structure clean; avoid special characters or emojis.
        
    - Check that adjectives match the destination’s tone and that descriptions are culturally sensitive.
        
- **Preferred words and phrases:**
    
    - “Day‑by‑Day,” “Itinerary,” “Journey,” “Route,” “Road Trip,” “Epic,” “Enchanting,” “Exploring,” “Experience,” “Hidden Gems,” “Ultimate,” “Cultural,” “Adventure,” “Food Lover’s,” “Family‑Friendly,” “Escape,” “Trail,” “Scenic,” “Off‑the‑Beaten‑Path.”
        
- **Words and patterns to avoid:**
    
    - Generic terms like “Trip Itinerary” or “Plan Your Trip” without specifics.
        
    - Overused adjectives such as “amazing,” “awesome” or “nice.”
        
    - Ambiguous timeframes (e.g., “several days”).
        
    - Acronyms or industry jargon not widely understood.
        
    - Clickbait phrases (“Unbelievable,” “Secret trick”) and misrepresentations.
        
    - Spelling out numbers (“Seven‑Day” instead of “7‑Day”) which can reduce search visibility.
        
    - Combining too many themes (e.g., “Budget Luxury Eco Adventure Cultural Foodie Tour”).
        
    - Redundant words like “Itinerary guide plan.”
        
- **Final quality checklist:**
    
    - Does the title specify the number of days and the destination clearly?
        
    - Are keywords like destination and theme front‑loaded?
        
    - Does the title convey the trip’s tone and highlights accurately and enticingly?
        
    - Is it within the preferred word count and free of unnecessary words?
        
    - Are digits used for numbers and formatting consistent across itineraries?
        
    - Does it avoid generic phrasing and clickbait?
        
    - Have you ensured cultural sensitivity and accuracy of descriptors?
        
    - Have you checked for proper spelling, grammar and style consistency?
