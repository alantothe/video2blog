## Feature Story

- **Purpose of titles**: Introduce a narrative or human‑interest story with enough intrigue and detail to draw readers into a longer, more experiential piece.
    
- **Audience mindset**: Curious readers seeking depth, context and storytelling rather than quick tips; they expect authenticity and a compelling angle.
    
- **Title structure rules**:
    
    - Craft a one‑sentence snapshot that hints at the story’s subject, conflict or unique angle.
        
    - Use strong, active verbs (reveal, explore, uncover, confront) and specific nouns.
        
    - Name the protagonist, organisation or place if widely recognised or central to the story.
        
    - Consider a colon structure: an evocative phrase followed by a clarifying clause (e.g., “Breaking Barriers: A Dancer’s Journey in Mumbai”).
        
    - Avoid excessive modifiers; let the inherent story provide the intrigue.
        
    - Keep titles under 12 words; shorten by removing unnecessary articles and conjunctions.
        
    - Use present tense to convey immediacy and relevance.
        
- **Hook and angle strategy**:
    
    - Highlight what makes the story unique—an unexpected challenge, cultural twist or personal triumph.
        
    - Use specific adjectives sparingly to add emotion without slipping into hyperbole.
        
    - Incorporate conflict or tension where appropriate to raise stakes (“fighting,” “transforming,” “navigating”).
        
    - For profiles, centre the person’s voice or distinctive achievement; emphasise why it matters now.
        
    - Avoid ambiguous or generic hooks; clearly set expectations about the narrative’s focus.
        
    - Maintain authenticity; do not promise “untold” stories unless truly exclusive.
        
    - Steer clear of clickbait; intrigue should stem from the story’s substance, not shock value.
        
- **Style, tone, and formatting rules**:
    
    - Thoughtful and sophisticated yet accessible; avoid slang or gimmicks.
        
    - Use title case; capitalise the first and principal words.
        
    - Avoid numerals and list signals unless the feature genuinely uses a list format.
        
    - Refrain from ellipses, question marks or exclamation points; rely on narrative strength.
        
    - Keep language precise; replace broad adjectives (amazing) with concrete descriptors.
        
    - Do not front‑load clichés or stock phrases; originality is essential.
        
    - Ensure the title reflects the story’s tone—serious, uplifting, investigative—to avoid misleading readers.
        
- **Preferred words and phrases**:
    
    - inside, behind the scenes, untold story, journey, revealing, exploring
        
    - portrait of, voices of, inside look at, in the heart of
        
    - rise of, fall of, resurgence of, revival of, transformation of
        
    - changing, shaping, redefining, navigating
        
    - uncovering, tracing, following, chronicling
        
    - cultural, social, environmental, political (for topical relevance)
        
    - personal, poignant, inspiring, overlooked (when accurate)
        
    - the making of, origins of, history of, future of
        
- **Words and patterns to avoid**:
    
    - Sensational hooks like **“You won’t believe,” “Jaw‑dropping,”** or **“Shocking truth.”**
        
    - Generic descriptors (**“amazing,” “incredible,” “awesome,”**) without specifics.
        
    - Tired clichés (**“heart‑warming,” “rags to riches,” “the next big thing”**) unless the story genuinely fits.
        
    - Hyperbolic superlatives (**“greatest ever,” “most unbelievable”**) without proof.
        
    - Overused phrases like **“once in a lifetime,” “best kept secret,”** or **“something for everyone.”**
        
    - Long subtitles or stacked colons that confuse rather than clarify.
        
    - Exclamation points or question marks intended solely to provoke curiosity.
        
    - Names or acronyms unfamiliar to the audience without context.
        
- **Final quality checklist**:
    
    - Does the title capture the essence and conflict of the story in one sentence?
        
    - Are strong verbs and specific nouns used to convey action and focus?
        
    - Is the title free from clichés and hyperbole?
        
    - Does it match the tone and depth of the feature?
        
    - Is it concise and grammatically correct (no run‑on phrases)?
        
    - Are names and terms recognisable or adequately contextualised?
        
    - Does it avoid clickbait formulas and sensational punctuation?
        
    - Have unnecessary articles and filler words been removed?
        
    - Is the present tense used where appropriate?
