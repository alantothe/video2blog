## Where to Stay Guide

### Purpose & Reader Intent

- **Purpose** – To help readers choose the right neighborhood and lodging for their travel style, budget and needs. A good guide explains how different areas feel, highlights pros and cons of various accommodation types, and advises on logistics like proximity to attractions and transport.
    
- **Reader Intent** – Readers want to quickly identify the best areas for families, nightlife, sightseeing or business travel and understand lodging options from budget hostels to luxury hotels. They expect trustworthy recommendations and practical booking advice.


### Core Content Expectations

- **Destination overview and neighbourhood primer** – Begin with a concise introduction to the city/region and discuss how it's laid out. Present a quick summary table or list of recommended neighborhoods, highlighting their vibe (e.g., historic, trendy, family‑friendly) and accessibility.
    
- **Detailed neighbourhood profiles** – For each recommended area, describe its atmosphere, main attractions, safety, transport links and who it suits (families, nightlife seekers, luxury travellers). Include insights from locals or personal experience and note approximate distances to major sights.
    
- **Accommodation types and examples** – Explain different lodging categories available: chain hotels, boutique or unique hotels that reflect the local culture, guesthouses, apartments, hostels or campgrounds. Summarize amenities, pros and cons (e.g., chain hotels offer consistent standards but may lack character).
    
- **Practical booking guidance** – Discuss approximate price ranges for budget, midrange and luxury options (per night). Provide tips on reading reviews, requesting specific rooms and confirming reservations. Suggest booking early during peak seasons.
    
- **Suitability by traveller type** – Offer recommendations for different needs: families (quiet areas, self‑catering accommodation), couples (romantic or boutique hotels), backpackers (hostels), luxury seekers (high‑end hotels or unique stays).
    
- **Location criteria** – Emphasize the importance of location: proximity to public transport, attractions, and dining; central vs. suburban; safety considerations. When describing individual properties, highlight location, amenities, room types, rates and service.


### Optional Enhancing Elements

- **Maps and visuals** – A simple map showing neighbourhoods and lodging clusters helps readers orient themselves.
    
- **FAQs** – Include a short Q&A summarizing the best areas for specific traveller types (families, nightlife, shopping).
    
- **Local tips and cultural context** – Add brief notes on cultural norms, local regulations or unique lodging experiences (e.g., ryokan stays in Japan).
    
- **Seasonal considerations** – Discuss how pricing or availability changes with seasons; advise travellers to book during shoulder seasons for better rates.


### Signs the Transcript Is Insufficient

- The transcript lists accommodation names without describing neighbourhoods or explaining why they are suitable.
    
- No information about location, amenities, service quality or price ranges; the guide doesn't differentiate between lodging types.
    
- Lacking context on whom each area or lodging option suits (e.g., families vs. party‑goers).
    
- Omits practical booking advice or safety considerations.


### Editorial Flexibility Notes

- Writers can prioritize neighbourhoods differently based on the city's character or audience (e.g., focusing on budget areas for backpacker readers or upscale districts for luxury audiences). There is room to inject personal experiences or anecdotes, but ensure recommendations remain well‑rounded.
    
- The structure does not have to follow a strict list; creative organisation (e.g., grouping by themes like "historic districts" or "beachfront areas") is acceptable if it helps readers make decisions.
