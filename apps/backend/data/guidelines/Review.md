## Review Guide

### Purpose & Reader Intent

A review evaluates a single product, service or place in depth to help readers decide whether it meets their needs. Readers expect **honest, expert judgement** based on first‑hand experience. Good reviews are written from the user’s perspective, demonstrate expertise and provide evidence of hands‑on use.

### Core Content Expectations

1. **Context and positioning:** Introduce the product or service, its intended audience and where it sits within its category. Explain what problems it aims to solve.
    
2. **User‑centric evaluation:** Assess the product from the reader’s point of view, showing that you understand typical use cases and decision criteria.
    
3. **Demonstrate expertise:** Explain why you are qualified to review this item—through professional experience or extensive research—and provide evidence such as photos, audio clips or links that show real‑world testing.
    
4. **Quantitative measurements:** Share data on how the product measures up in key performance categories (e.g., battery life, sound quality, comfort). Use numbers, ratings or benchmarks.
    
5. **Distinctive features:** Explain what sets the product apart from competitors. Describe key design choices and how they affect users beyond the manufacturer’s claims.
    
6. **Pros and cons:** Provide balanced commentary on benefits and drawbacks, based on original research and first‑hand experience.
    
7. **Comparative context:** Mention comparable products and discuss which might be better for specific circumstances.
    
8. **Evolution and longevity:** Note how the product has evolved from previous versions or what improvements it offers over alternatives.
    
9. **Decision factors and recommendation:** Highlight the most important factors for the reader’s decision (e.g., fuel economy and safety in a car review) and conclude with a clear verdict or recommendation. If recommending the product as “best overall” or “best for a use case,” explain why and provide evidence.
    
10. **Resource links and purchasing options:** Include links to additional resources and, if appropriate, multiple sellers so readers can explore further.
    

### Optional Enhancing Elements

- **Visuals and multimedia:** Original photos, charts, unboxing videos or audio samples that bring the experience to life.
    
- **User anecdotes:** Short stories or quotes from real users can provide additional perspectives and social proof.
    
- **Comparison tables:** Summaries of how the product stacks up against competitors on key metrics.
    
- **Discussion of sustainability or ethics:** If relevant, include information on environmental impact, labour practices or social considerations.
    

### Signs the Transcript Is Insufficient

- The transcript lacks first‑hand observations—no descriptions of how the product performs, feels or fits into daily life.
    
- No quantitative data or metrics are presented; performance claims are vague.
    
- There is no discussion of comparable products or the competitive landscape.
    
- The narrative is one‑sided (only positive or only negative) without acknowledging pros and cons.
    
- The reviewer’s expertise and testing methods are unclear; no evidence of authenticity.
    

### Editorial Flexibility Notes

Reviews can vary in tone—from conversational to technical—and may include humour or personal anecdotes. They can be structured with or without formal section headings, but they **must remain transparent and honest**. Affiliate links are acceptable, but the writer should disclose them and maintain independence. Multimedia elements and rating scales are optional, but the core analysis should not be reduced to a score; readers should understand the reasons behind the rating. Writers can focus on aspects most relevant to their audience but should always give enough context for informed decision‑making.

## General Notes 

- **Reader focus:** Regardless of article type, content must be tailored to the target audience’s knowledge level and interests. Avoid jargon, or define it when unavoidable.
    
- **Evidence and citations:** Whenever factual claims are made, they should be supported by credible sources. Linking to primary studies, reputable news sites or official documents enhances trust.
    
- **Narrative flow:** Each article should have a clear beginning, middle and end. Even FAQ and pros/cons lists benefit from short introductions and conclusions to frame the content.
    
- **Avoid redundancy:** Ensure that points are not repeated without adding new information. Repetition can indicate that the transcript lacks sufficient detail and may need enrichment.
    

These guidelines provide qualitative standards rather than rigid templates, enabling writers and AI systems to craft varied yet high‑quality articles across different formats. Use them to assess whether a transcript contains the necessary material or requires supplementation through research or additional context.
