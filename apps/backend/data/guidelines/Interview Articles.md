## Interview Articles Guide

**Purpose & Reader Intent**

- An interview article captures a **conversation between interviewer and interviewee**, conveying the interviewee's insights, experiences or personality. Readers expect authentic quotes, context about who is speaking and why they matter, and a narrative structure that makes the conversation engaging.
    
- The piece should let the subject's voice shine while guiding readers through the themes explored.


**Core Content Expectations**

- **Introduction and context:** An interview article must introduce the interviewee, explaining their background and relevance. Provide context about why the conversation is worth reading and what the reader will gain.
    
- **Organised themes:** Rather than dumping a transcript, the article should be segmented by themes or subjects discussed. This helps readers follow the narrative and find the parts most relevant to them.
    
- **Clear Q&A or narrative:** Present questions and answers in a manner that preserves clarity. This can be a direct Q&A format or a paraphrased narrative interspersed with quotes.
    
- **Use of quotes:** Direct quotations are essential to convey the interviewee's character and voice. Quotes should illustrate key points rather than repeat what the writer has already summarised. Brafton advises letting quotes express feelings and experiences rather than paraphrasing them.
    
- **Narrative flow:** Arrange quotes and commentary so the article reads like a story, with a beginning, middle and end. Brafton suggests first identifying the "edge pieces" – the main points that structure the article – then filling in the middle with supporting content and quotes.
    
- **Conclusion and takeaways:** End by summarising the most important insights or themes, and, if appropriate, offering reflections or next steps.
    
- **Research and preparation:** A good interview requires planning. Select an interviewee with relevant insight and research their background. Prepare more questions than you need and include open‑ended queries to elicit storytelling.


**Optional Enhancing Elements**

- **Scene‑setting details:** Describe the interview setting or the interviewee's demeanor to create atmosphere.
    
- **Contextual sidebars:** Brief explanations of references made by the interviewee can help readers unfamiliar with certain topics.
    
- **Narrator's reflection:** The interviewer may weave in reflections or connect interviewee remarks to broader themes.
    
- **Multimedia:** Audio clips or video snippets of the interview can enrich digital articles.
    
- **Humour and personality:** Brafton encourages starting with a hook and using a conversational tone; sprinkling in personality and anecdotes can make the piece more engaging.


**Signs the Transcript Is Insufficient**

- **Lack of interview structure:** If the transcript is a monologue or a scattered conversation without identifiable questions and answers, it may be hard to craft an interview article.
    
- **Superficial answers:** Short, non‑substantive responses yield little to write about. If the interviewee doesn't elaborate, there may not be enough material to explore.
    
- **Missing introduction or conclusion:** Without context about who is speaking or why it matters, the piece will feel incomplete. Similarly, an abrupt ending without summarising insights leaves readers unsatisfied.
    
- **Overlong tangents:** If the conversation wanders extensively off topic and provides little relevant insight, heavy editing or follow‑up interviews may be necessary.


**Editorial Flexibility Notes**

- Interview articles can be formatted as **direct Q&A**, **narrative features** or **hybrid profiles**. The writer's voice can be present to provide transitions, context or personal reflections, but should not overpower the interviewee's voice.
    
- The structure need not be linear; thematic grouping or reverse‑chronological order can work if it enhances clarity.
    
- Writers should feel free to adjust question order, combine related answers or omit irrelevant exchanges to improve flow, provided quotes remain accurate.
    
- Tone may range from formal to conversational depending on the publication and subject. Keeping a conversational tone and letting personality shine can engage readers.
