## Opinion Pieces Guide

**Purpose & Reader Intent**

- Opinion articles (op‑eds, columns or personal essays) exist to **persuade, critique or provoke thought**. Readers expect a clear stance, supported by reasoning and evidence, and they often seek a fresh or personal perspective on a topical issue.
    
- The goal is to influence what readers think or feel, or to encourage a particular action or policy. Unlike news reports, opinion pieces are inherently subjective but must still be grounded in facts and logic.


**Core Content Expectations**

- **A single, well‑defined argument:** Duke's op‑ed guidelines emphasise that writers should make one point and "do it well," warning that trying to cover too much dilutes the message. The thesis should be expressible in a sentence or two.
    
- **Strong hook and clear statement of position:** The main point should appear at the top; you have only a few seconds to hook busy readers.
    
- **Reader relevance:** The author must tell readers why the issue matters to them. Duke advises writers to ask "So what? Who cares?" to clarify relevance.
    
- **Evidence and reasoning:** Support the opinion with facts, statistics, historical context, expert quotes or personal experiences. Even personal narratives should serve the broader argument.
    
- **Personal voice:** Opinion pieces should be personal and reflect the author's perspective. Duke notes that op‑eds need to be personal and advocate persuasively, and encourages writers to embrace personal experience.
    
- **Concrete recommendations or calls to action:** The best opinion pieces suggest what readers should do, think or feel. Duke stresses that op‑eds aren't mere analysis but should advocate for something.
    
- **Acknowledgement of counterarguments:** Recognising opposing views makes an argument more credible. Duke advises authors to acknowledge the other side rather than piling on reasons they're right.
    
- **Compelling conclusion:** A strong ending summarises the argument and often returns to the opening hook.


**Optional Enhancing Elements**

- **Anecdotes and storytelling:** Vivid examples help readers remember arguments.
    
- **Humour or irony:** When appropriate, a light touch can make serious points more digestible.
    
- **Data visualisations or sidebars:** Charts or brief call‑out boxes can illustrate key statistics or quotes.
    
- **Multimedia elements:** In digital formats, embedded videos or audio clips can enhance persuasion.


**Signs the Transcript Is Insufficient**

- **No clear thesis or stance:** If the transcript meanders without taking a position, there is no backbone for an opinion piece.
    
- **Lack of evidence or reasoning:** Unsupported assertions or purely emotional rhetoric will weaken credibility.
    
- **Absence of personal voice:** If the transcript is written like a news report, lacking personal perspective, the piece will feel generic.
    
- **No call to action or conclusion:** A rant without resolution or guidance will leave readers unsatisfied.


**Editorial Flexibility Notes**

- While the structure (hook, thesis, body, conclusion) is common, writers may experiment with narrative forms, such as **chronological stories**, dialogues or letters, as long as they maintain clarity and persuasive focus.
    
- Tone can range from earnest to satirical, but **avoid jargon** and use short sentences. Creative language is encouraged if it serves clarity and engagement.
    
- Writers may incorporate opposing voices directly (through quotes or imagined interlocutors) to enrich the debate. There is no requirement to balance arguments equally, but fairness and acknowledgment of complexity build trust.
