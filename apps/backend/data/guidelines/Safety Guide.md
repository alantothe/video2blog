## Safety Guide

### Purpose & Reader Intent

- Help readers understand potential risks, scams and hazards associated with a destination or activity.
    
- Equip them with practical strategies to avoid danger and respond if something goes wrong.
    
- Readers expect actionable advice rooted in specific scenarios rather than vague warnings.


### Core Content Expectations

- **Identifiable Threats:** Specific descriptions of common scams, crime hot spots, health risks, or natural hazards. Concrete examples help ground the information.
    
- **Prevention Strategies:** Clear, doable precautions (e.g., secure belongings, avoid certain neighborhoods at night, use licensed transportation).
    
- **Emergency Resources:** Details on local emergency numbers, embassy contact info, relevant insurance needs, or local language phrases for seeking help.
    
- **Impact & Consequences:** A realistic sense of what can happen if precautions are ignored, without sensationalizing.


### Optional Enhancing Elements

- Background on how local authorities are addressing safety issues.
    
- Interviews or anecdotes from locals or travellers who experienced incidents and learned from them.
    
- Links to official government or travel advisories for further reading.
    
- Visual aids like maps of safe zones or photos of official taxi signage (described rather than embedded).


### Signs the Transcript Is Insufficient

- Only generic "be careful" statements without specifics.
    
- Lack of distinct scenarios, e.g., no mention of particular scams or problem areas.
    
- No practical prevention steps or emergency instructions.
    
- Omits context explaining why certain precautions matter (cultural differences, legal conditions).
    
- Repetitive warnings that don't add new information.


### Editorial Flexibility Notes

- Encourage a firm but calm tone; avoid alarmist language.
    
- The narrative can blend prescriptive advice with personal observations, but should always return to actionable safety.
    
- Sections may vary in length depending on the depth of available information; the sequence of topics can shift if it improves flow.
    
- Metaphors or light humor can make heavy topics more readable as long as they do not trivialize risk.
