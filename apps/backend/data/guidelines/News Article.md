## News Article Guide

### Purpose & Reader Intent

A news article exists to **report timely events or announcements succinctly and accurately**. Readers expect to learn the essential facts quickly — the classic five Ws and H (who, what, when, where, why and how) — plus context about why the event matters. News articles should be **neutral**, factual and avoid editorializing. They are often structured with the most important information at the top (the inverted‑pyramid approach).

### Core Content Expectations

- **Essential Facts (Five Ws & H).** The article must convey who is involved, what happened, when and where it happened, why it occurred and how it unfolded. This information should appear near the beginning of the piece.
    
- **Strong Lead (Lede).** The opening paragraph should summarize the most significant information and grab the reader's attention. It should be concise and avoid burying the point of the story.
    
- **Nut Graf.** Following the lead, a paragraph should provide supporting facts and context to back up the lead.
    
- **Attribution and Quotes.** Statements, opinions and non‑verifiable facts must be attributed to named sources. Quotes from key participants or witnesses add credibility and human interest.
    
- **Identification of People.** On first reference, use full name and title; thereafter use the last name only.
    
- **Context and Background.** Brief history or context is essential so that readers understand significance and impact.
    
- **Clear, Simple Language.** Complex terms or jargon should be explained for a general audience.


### Optional Enhancing Elements

- **Data or statistics** to quantify impact (e.g., attendance numbers, financial figures).
    
- **Multiple viewpoints**, including comments from different stakeholders, to provide balance.
    
- **Visuals** such as charts, timelines or photos to illustrate the event.
    
- **Sidebar or box** providing background information or related resources.
    
- **Links to original documents or sources**, where appropriate.


### Signs the Transcript Is Insufficient

- Missing one or more of the five Ws or lacking a clear sequence of events.
    
- No direct quotes or identifiable sources; statements are vague or unattributed.
    
- Lack of context (e.g., why the event matters or how it relates to previous developments).
    
- Conflicting details that cannot be verified without additional reporting.
    
- Excessive digressions or opinionated commentary that make it hard to isolate factual information.


### Editorial Flexibility Notes

News articles commonly follow the inverted‑pyramid structure, but they need not be formulaic. Some stories may benefit from a **martini glass** or chronological approach for events that unfold over time. Writers have creative licence in crafting leads and headlines — they can use puns or quotes for flair as long as they remain accurate. Paragraphs should stay short to aid readability, but the narrative flow can vary. Balance concision with completeness; avoid unnecessary repetition or filler.
