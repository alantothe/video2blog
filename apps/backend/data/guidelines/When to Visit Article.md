## When to Visit Article Guide

### Purpose & Reader Intent

- **Purpose** – To inform readers about the optimal times to visit a destination based on weather, crowd levels, cost, and special events. The article helps travellers align their visit with personal priorities such as climate, festival attendance, or budget.
    
- **Reader Intent** – Readers want to know how seasons and months differ, what trade‑offs exist between peak and off‑peak periods, and how to plan accordingly. They expect factual climate insights, event schedules and planning tips.


### Core Content Expectations

- **Season overview** – Define the destination's travel seasons: peak (high season), shoulder (mid‑season) and off‑season. Describe typical weather conditions and daylight hours for each period. For example, peak months in many destinations offer sun and long days but heavy crowds and high prices, while shoulder seasons balance decent weather with fewer tourists. Off‑season travel can be cheaper and quieter but may involve cold weather, shorter hours or limited services.
    
- **Pros and cons of each season** – Explain advantages and drawbacks: comfortable temperatures, festivals and natural phenomena vs. crowds, accommodation costs and availability. Highlight shoulder season benefits such as lower prices and manageable crowds.
    
- **Monthly or regional variations** – Provide month‑by‑month or regional notes when conditions vary widely (e.g., cherry blossom season in Japan draws huge crowds and requires early booking; wildflowers bloom in Greece's shoulder season; many U.S. national parks have optimal months for wildlife, hiking or cooler temperatures).
    
- **Special events and festivals** – Mention major events, holidays or wildlife migrations that can influence travel timing. Advise readers to book early for popular events or avoid them if seeking quiet.
    
- **Budget considerations** – Note how accommodation and flight prices change with seasons. Recommend travelling off‑peak or shoulder seasons to save money.
    
- **Planning and flexibility tips** – Encourage readers to align travel timing with personal priorities and be flexible due to annual variations. Provide guidance on packing for different seasons and making reservations during busy periods.


### Optional Enhancing Elements

- **Climate charts or tables** – Simple visuals summarising temperature, rainfall and daylight hours by month can aid planning.
    
- **Sample itineraries** – Suggest season‑specific activities or itineraries (e.g., winter skiing vs. summer festivals).
    
- **Sustainable travel notes** – Discuss how visiting outside of peak season can reduce over‑tourism and support local economies year‑round.
    
- **Local insights** – Include quotes or tips from locals about seasonal nuances.


### Signs the Transcript Is Insufficient

- It fails to mention seasons or weather variations; the article states only that the destination can be visited "any time" without explaining differences.
    
- There is no discussion of crowd levels, costs or events; readers can't make informed decisions.
    
- The transcript includes inaccurate or vague timing references without specific months or seasons.


### Editorial Flexibility Notes

- Writers may present the information chronologically (month by month) or by season. They can focus more on events or weather depending on destination. A conversational tone or storytelling style is acceptable as long as factual accuracy is maintained.
    
- Depth of detail should correspond to the complexity of the destination's climate. Avoid generic filler; highlight the most meaningful timing considerations.
