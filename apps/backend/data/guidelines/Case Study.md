## Case Study Guide

### Purpose & Reader Intent

A case study demonstrates **how a specific problem was solved**, typically for business or marketing purposes. Readers want a **real‑world example** of a challenge similar to their own and clear evidence of results. Effective case studies build trust by showing the process from problem to solution and quantifying the impact.

### Core Content Expectations

- **Problem / Present Situation.** Clearly describe the initial situation, including what was at stake and potential risks. Provide enough context about the organization, individual or situation to make the problem relatable.
    
- **Action Taken / Solution.** Detail the steps, strategies or interventions used to address the problem. Mention who was involved and any resources or constraints.
    
- **Results and Impact.** Explain the immediate results of the actions and discuss longer‑term impact. Use metrics, percentages or other data to quantify outcomes. Include testimonials or quotes when available.
    
- **Narrative Flow.** Follow a clear progression: introduction, problem, solution, and conclusion. A more detailed structure can include a title, snapshot of key facts, introduction, context, challenge, solution, implementation, analysis, outcomes and next steps.
    
- **Validation.** Attribute statements and metrics to credible sources; verify data and include multiple viewpoints when possible.


### Optional Enhancing Elements

- **Visuals or tables** that summarise key metrics or before‑and‑after comparisons.
    
- **Quotes from stakeholders** (client, team members, customers) to humanize the story and provide social proof.
    
- **Industry benchmarks or research** to contextualize the results.
    
- **Lessons learned or next steps** to demonstrate how the success can be replicated or scaled.
    
- **Call to action** if the case study is intended for marketing purposes (e.g., how readers can achieve similar results).


### Signs the Transcript Is Insufficient

- No clear description of the initial problem or why it matters.
    
- Lack of specific actions taken; vague language like "we improved things" without details.
    
- Missing metrics or evidence of results; no quantitative or qualitative outcomes.
    
- Quotes are absent or generic, making it hard to verify the story.
    
- The narrative jumps around without a logical sequence from problem to solution.


### Editorial Flexibility Notes

Case studies benefit from clarity and focus but can be tailored to the audience. The PARI (Problem, Action, Result, Impact) framework is one approach; the more detailed blueprint from TimelyText suggests additional sections. Writers may adjust the order or emphasis depending on the most compelling element (for instance, leading with a striking result to hook readers). Tone can range from conversational to formal; include enough story to engage readers but avoid turning the piece into a sales pitch.
