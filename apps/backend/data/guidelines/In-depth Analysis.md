## In-depth Analysis Guide

**Purpose & Reader Intent**

- An in‑depth analysis article aims to **explain the "why" and "how" behind a topic**, revealing connections, causes and implications. Readers expect more than a summary; they want context, research and insight that deepen their understanding and help them form their own views.
    
- These articles have a longer shelf life than news reports because they explore issues broadly and deeply.


**Core Content Expectations**

- **Analytical focus:** A defining feature of a good analysis is that it goes beyond listing facts to interpret them. The transcript should contain commentary on causes, effects, trends or relationships, not just event descriptions.
    
- **Thorough research:** The foundation of analysis is deep research. Journalism University stresses that analysis relies on reading studies, interviewing experts and gathering data. The transcript should reference such sources or evidence; if it doesn't, additional research may be required.
    
- **Framing questions:** Analytical pieces are driven by questions like "Why did this happen?" "What does this mean?" and "What happens next?". Look for this exploratory mindset in the transcript.
    
- **Multiple perspectives:** A robust analysis considers different viewpoints, stakeholders or disciplines. It should not be a single‑angle polemic.
    
- **Structured argument:** A coherent structure typically includes a hook, a **nut graf** explaining the thesis, a body that explores supporting themes or evidence and a conclusion that ties insights together. While creative variations exist, the transcript should provide enough material to organise an argument.
    
- **Insights and implications:** Beyond describing causes, good analysis proposes implications or potential solutions. The transcript should attempt to answer "What does this mean for readers or society?"
    
- **Audience and publication awareness:** The article should be tailored to its intended audience. The Journalism University guide notes that tone and style vary depending on who you are writing for and where it will be published.


**Optional Enhancing Elements**

- **Data visualisations:** Charts, graphs or infographics can clarify complex relationships.
    
- **Primary reporting:** Interviews with experts or affected individuals add depth and originality.
    
- **Historical or comparative context:** Comparing the current issue to past events or similar situations in other regions enriches understanding.
    
- **Frameworks or models:** Explaining theoretical models or frameworks can help readers organise information.
    
- **Interactive elements:** Timelines, maps or sliders can engage readers and illustrate changes over time.


**Signs the Transcript Is Insufficient**

- **Only descriptive information:** If the transcript merely recounts events without analysis, it cannot stand alone as an in‑depth piece.
    
- **No evidence or sources:** A transcript that lacks references to data, studies or interviews will require substantial research before publishing.
    
- **Single viewpoint:** A one‑sided commentary without acknowledging other perspectives lacks depth.
    
- **Disorganised or rambling structure:** Analysis requires an argument; if the transcript jumps between topics without clear connections, it needs significant restructuring.


**Editorial Flexibility Notes**

- Analysis can be structured in various ways: chronological narratives, thematic sections, or problem/solution formats. The key is **clarity of argument**, not adherence to a rigid template.
    
- Writers should feel free to use storytelling techniques, such as opening with an anecdote or weaving in mini case studies, to humanise abstract topics.
    
- The tone can range from academic to conversational. It should respect the subject's complexity without overwhelming readers with jargon or dense prose. Concise, precise language is critical.
    
- While a traditional nut‑graf‑driven structure is common, long‑form investigations may require multiple threads that converge in the conclusion. Flexibility in organisation is acceptable as long as the reader can follow the logic.
