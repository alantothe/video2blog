## Disqualifiers Guide

**Purpose & Reader Intent**

- A disqualifier article exists to **identify who should not pursue a particular product, service or course of action**. It is a filtering mechanism that saves readers time and money by candidly explaining when an option is a poor fit.
    
- Readers seek transparency; they want to know whether their circumstances, values or needs make them unsuitable for what's being discussed. By being upfront about limitations, the article builds trust and credibility.


**Core Content Expectations**

- **Clear scope:** State what is being evaluated (a product, program, investment, diet, career path, etc.) and why there may be reasons to avoid it.
    
- **Explicit disqualifying criteria:** List specific conditions, traits or situations that make the option unsuitable. These might include budget thresholds, technical requirements, time commitments, health contraindications or ethical considerations. The ImpactPlus example of a product‑fit video shows that covering "who should not buy" helps weed out bad‑fit leads and builds trust.
    
- **Reasoning:** For each disqualifier, explain why it matters. Connecting disqualification to outcomes (e.g., "If you plan to use this tool once a year, you won't recoup the subscription cost") helps readers make informed decisions.
    
- **Balanced perspective:** A credible disqualifier article should also briefly highlight who **is** a good fit and why, making clear that the product or action isn't universally bad.
    
- **Alternatives or next steps:** Suggest other options for those who are disqualified (e.g., recommending free software or a different strategy). This transforms a negative into a helpful outcome.
    
- **Evidence or examples:** Use data, case studies or customer stories to support disqualifications where possible.


**Optional Enhancing Elements**

- **Interactive checklists or self‑assessment:** A yes/no questionnaire can help readers quickly determine fit.
    
- **Expert or user quotes:** Hearing from someone who faced a misfit scenario lends authenticity.
    
- **Transparency about motives:** Explaining why you are disqualifying readers (to save their time, to uphold ethical standards, etc.) strengthens trust.
    
- **Contextual data:** Market statistics or industry benchmarks can illustrate why certain thresholds matter (e.g., average costs, typical time investments).


**Signs the Transcript Is Insufficient**

- **No disqualifying criteria:** If the transcript only praises or describes an option without exploring who should avoid it, there is nothing to build a disqualifier article from.
    
- **Vague or generic warnings:** Statements like "it's not for everyone" without specifics fail to inform. Concrete reasons must be provided.
    
- **Lack of reasoning:** Simply listing disqualifiers without explaining the consequences or trade‑offs leaves readers with unsupported assertions.
    
- **One‑sided negativity:** If the transcript is entirely negative without acknowledging appropriate use cases, it risks sounding like a rant rather than a helpful filter.


**Editorial Flexibility Notes**

- The tone can vary from candid and conversational to analytical. Some disqualifier pieces may take a humorous approach ("You’re a night owl? This 5 AM boot camp probably isn't for you"), while others may be serious if stakes are high (e.g., medical or financial advice).
    
- Writers should feel free to structure the article around scenarios, FAQs or myth‑busting formats rather than a simple list. The key is clarity and honesty, not adherence to a rigid template.
    
- Don't be afraid to admit nuance. If certain factors could be mitigated (e.g., cost with discounts), mention that rather than making absolute statements.
