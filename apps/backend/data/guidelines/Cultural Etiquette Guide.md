## Cultural Etiquette Guide

### Purpose & Reader Intent

- Prepare travellers to respect local customs, traditions and social expectations.
    
- Prevent misunderstandings or offense by explaining do's and don'ts.
    
- Readers want both practical tips and an understanding of cultural rationale.


### Core Content Expectations

- **Key Social Norms:** Greetings, gestures, dress codes, gift‑giving customs, dining etiquette, and rules around language or personal space.
    
- **Context & Reasons:** Brief explanations of why certain behaviors are valued or taboo.
    
- **Examples & Scenarios:** Illustrative situations (e.g., visiting someone's home, interacting in markets, using public transportation) and how to behave appropriately.
    
- **Consequences:** Potential social ramifications of missteps (e.g., perceived rudeness, fines, or exclusion).
    
- **Variation Awareness:** Acknowledge regional differences and that not all locals follow strict rules.


### Optional Enhancing Elements

- Historical or religious background that shaped customs.
    
- Quotations from local residents providing personal perspective.
    
- Comparative notes for travellers to contrast with their own culture.
    
- Tips on simple language phrases or courtesy words.


### Signs the Transcript Is Insufficient

- Only a few superficial do's and don'ts without context or examples.
    
- No explanation of why customs exist, leaving tips feeling arbitrary.
    
- Lacks coverage of multiple settings (social, religious, professional).
    
- Omits any consequences or cultural significance.
    
- Repetition of basic information without deeper insight.


### Editorial Flexibility Notes

- Maintain a respectful, curious tone; avoid stereotyping.
    
- Organize content by theme or scenario rather than rigid sections; adapt to the transcript's strengths.
    
- Use inclusive language that invites readers to learn rather than scold them for ignorance.
    
- Storytelling or personal anecdotes can illustrate customs effectively if they remain respectful and accurate.
