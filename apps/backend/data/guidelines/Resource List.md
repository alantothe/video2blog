## Resource List Guide

### Purpose & reader intent

Resource lists curate tools, websites, services or references on a specific topic. Readers look for vetted recommendations, brief descriptions of what each resource offers and enough context to decide which to explore. Curated lists should stay on theme and deliver value beyond a simple directory.

### Core content expectations

- **Contextual introduction** – Open with a short paragraph explaining the theme, why these resources are valuable and any selection criteria. Readers should understand what problem the list solves.
    
- **Curated and annotated entries** – Each resource needs a descriptive title plus a concise annotation: what it is, its main benefits or unique features and how it helps the reader. Annotations should be brief but informative to maintain skimmability.
    
- **Logical grouping** – When the list contains many resources, group them into categories (e.g., booking sites, travel insurance providers, destination blogs) for easier navigation.
    
- **Consistent formatting** – Use bullets or numbered entries with uniform presentation. Consistency helps readers compare options quickly.
    
- **Links or references** – Provide direct links (where appropriate) so readers can easily access each resource. Ensure the titles accurately reflect the linked content and avoid misleading clickbait.
    

### Optional enhancing elements

- **Evaluative commentary** – Briefly note pros and cons or situations for which a resource is best suited.
    
- **Comparison highlights** – For similar resources, mention distinguishing features (e.g., cost, regional focus, user friendliness).
    
- **Multimedia embeds** – Screenshots, logos or icons can increase visual interest but should not clutter the list.
    
- **Supplementary tips** – Offer advice on how to choose among the resources or combine them effectively.
    

### Signs the transcript is insufficient

- The transcript lists names without describing what they do, leaving readers unable to evaluate them.
    
- Items are unrelated or do not fit a clear theme, suggesting poor curation.
    
- Only a handful of resources are mentioned, with obvious gaps (e.g., only one booking site when the topic is "best booking tools").
    
- No introduction or explanation of how the resources were selected.
    

### Editorial flexibility notes

Resource lists benefit from a personable tone; writers can inject light commentary or personal experiences but should avoid overt bias. The number of resources can vary—shorter lists may allow more detailed annotations, whereas longer lists should keep descriptions brief and may link to deeper articles for extra details. Maintain readability with short paragraphs and ensure the title accurately reflects the list's scope.
