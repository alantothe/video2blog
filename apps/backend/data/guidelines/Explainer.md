## Explainer Guide

### Purpose & Reader Intent

Explainers **break down complex topics or news events into clear, accessible language**. Readers seek to understand **how and why** something happens, not just the basic facts. Explainer journalism is distinct from news reports in that it provides background, context and an answer to questions like "What's the deal with that? How does it work?". It often addresses topics that people find confusing or important.

### Core Content Expectations

- **Clear Definition of the Topic.** Begin by defining the subject and stating why it matters. The lede should highlight the most compelling fact or angle to hook readers.
    
- **Key Questions Framework.** Identify and answer the fundamental questions readers have: what is it, how does it work, why is it happening, who is involved, what are the implications. Sub‑headings phrased as questions can guide the structure.
    
- **Background and Context.** Provide historical or contextual information to help readers understand the development of the issue.
    
- **Simple, Accurate Explanations.** Break down technical or complex concepts into understandable language. Avoid jargon; if technical terms are necessary, define them.
    
- **Use of Evidence and Expert Insight.** Incorporate data, research and quotes from subject‑matter experts to support explanations.
    
- **Structure for Readability.** Divide the article into bite‑sized sections with clear sub‑headings; question‑based sub‑heds are common.
    
- **Visual Aids.** Charts, diagrams, timelines or other graphics can clarify the explanation.


### Optional Enhancing Elements

- **Comparisons or analogies** to familiar concepts to aid comprehension.
    
- **FAQs or myth‑busting sections** that address common misconceptions.
    
- **Interactive elements**, such as embedded calculators or quizzes.
    
- **Links to further reading** or authoritative sources for readers who want deeper detail.
    
- **Case examples or anecdotes** that illustrate how the concept applies in real life.


### Signs the Transcript Is Insufficient

- The topic is mentioned but not defined; no clear explanation of what it is or why it matters.
    
- The transcript only lists facts without addressing how or why.
    
- Absence of background information; readers cannot place the topic in context.
    
- Lack of expert input or data; explanations rely solely on opinion or speculation.
    
- Disorganized structure; no logical order or question‑led flow.


### Editorial Flexibility Notes

Explainers can vary widely in tone and format. Some use chronological narratives, while others adopt Q&A or thematic structures. Writers should choose the structure that best helps readers grasp the material and may incorporate storytelling techniques or humor to maintain interest. Though headings and sub‑heds often take the form of questions, it is not a strict requirement. The focus should be on clarity and reader comprehension rather than following a rigid formula. When appropriate, incorporate multimedia, data visualization and interactive components to enrich the explanation
