## Roundup Guide

### Purpose & Reader Intent

A roundup is a **curated overview of multiple options** within a product or service category. It summarises research and testing across the category and recommends one or more best items based on explicit criteria. Readers use roundups to quickly compare options and discover which might suit their needs.

### Core Content Expectations

1. **Defined scope and criteria:** Clearly state the category and any subcategories (e.g., “best budget action cameras”). Explain the criteria used to select and evaluate options—performance, price, features, ease of use, etc.
    
2. **Comprehensive research:** Demonstrate that the writer has “tried everything” or conducted extensive research; become an expert and share that expertise.
    
3. **Unbiased selection:** Focus on complementary or adjacent products rather than the publisher’s own offerings to avoid bias. Avoid writing roundups about your own product category.
    
4. **Curated list of options:** Present a list of the most relevant products or services, covering the key players in the space. Each entry should include:
    
    - A concise description of what it is and who it’s for.
        
    - Key strengths, weaknesses and unique selling points.
        
    - Why it was included and what differentiates it from others.
        
    - Situational recommendations (e.g., “best for…,” “ideal when…”).
        
5. **Comparison and trade‑offs:** Highlight how the listed options differ and what trade‑offs exist (e.g., price versus features). This helps readers match a product to their priorities.
    
6. **Grouped themes or categories:** For longer lists, group items by use case, price tier or other meaningful theme, and provide a brief explanation for each group. Curation adds value by making the list more than the sum of its parts.
    
7. **Your own perspective:** Don’t simply copy and paste information. Add your own analysis, explain why certain items stand out, and include contrarian viewpoints or unexpected angles to keep the article engaging.
    

### Optional Enhancing Elements

- **Expert insights or quotes:** Include perspectives from industry experts or power users to support your analysis.
    
- **Keyword and search context:** Briefly note why the topic matters or what search trends reveal about reader interest.
    
- **Visuals and tables:** Provide quick‑reference tables summarising key specs or ratings, or include photos of the products.
    
- **Buyer’s tips:** Offer advice on how to choose among the options or what to watch out for.
    
- **Data or testing notes:** Explain how products were tested or what resources were consulted (user forums, customer reviews, professional ratings).
    

### Signs the Transcript Is Insufficient

- The transcript only mentions one or two options, leaving no room for comparison.
    
- Selection criteria are not explained; readers can’t tell why these products were chosen or what differentiates them.
    
- Items are listed without descriptions, analysis or personal perspective; it feels like a copy‑paste list.
    
- The roundup is biased toward the publisher’s own product or lacks neutrality.
    
- No trade‑offs, groupings or context are discussed; the list doesn’t help readers make a decision.
    

### Editorial Flexibility Notes

Roundups can range from **short lists of three to five items** to long curated guides. The writer can choose to rank entries, group them by themes or simply present them in alphabetical order. Tone may be informal and conversational or more formal depending on the publication. Including multimedia, expert quotes or charts can increase engagement. Creativity in angles—such as focusing on unexpected criteria or including contrarian picks—helps roundups stand out, but writers must always provide clear reasons for inclusion.

## General Notes 

- **Reader focus:** Regardless of article type, content must be tailored to the target audience’s knowledge level and interests. Avoid jargon, or define it when unavoidable.
    
- **Evidence and citations:** Whenever factual claims are made, they should be supported by credible sources. Linking to primary studies, reputable news sites or official documents enhances trust.
    
- **Narrative flow:** Each article should have a clear beginning, middle and end. Even FAQ and pros/cons lists benefit from short introductions and conclusions to frame the content.
    
- **Avoid redundancy:** Ensure that points are not repeated without adding new information. Repetition can indicate that the transcript lacks sufficient detail and may need enrichment.
    

These guidelines provide qualitative standards rather than rigid templates, enabling writers and AI systems to craft varied yet high‑quality articles across different formats. Use them to assess whether a transcript contains the necessary material or requires supplementation through research or additional context.
