## Myth-Busting Article Guide

### Purpose & Reader Intent

Myth‑busting articles confront and correct common misconceptions or misinformation. Readers seek authoritative clarification on topics where falsehoods persist. According to best‑practice research on debunking misinformation, the process typically involves assessing which myths are worth debunking, inoculating the audience against misinformation and then debunking properly. The goal is to replace inaccurate beliefs with clear, evidence‑based explanations without inadvertently reinforcing the myth.

### Core Content Expectations

- **Identification of myths:** Clearly state each misconception or false belief that will be addressed. Limit repetition of the myth to avoid reinforcing it.
    
- **Presentation of factual information:** Lead with a concise, memorable fact that counters the myth. Ensure evidence comes from credible sources and is explained in accessible language.
    
- **Explanation of the fallacy:** Explain why the myth is wrong—highlight logical fallacies, outdated data or misunderstandings. Use analogies or simple scenarios to illustrate why the myth fails.
    
- **Reinforcement of correct information:** Finish by re‑emphasizing the factual explanation and offering an alternative causal narrative.
    
- **Audience awareness:** Consider who holds the misconception and why. Experts recommend that myth‑busting messages come from a source trusted by the target audience.
    

### Optional Enhancing Elements

- **Prebunking or inoculation:** Briefly warn readers about the existence of misinformation and pre‑emptively refute potential myths before addressing specific ones.
    
- **Case studies and examples:** Provide real‑world examples where the myth has caused harm or confusion, and show how correct information improves outcomes.
    
- **Visual aids:** Charts or infographics can illustrate data that counters myths and aid comprehension.
    
- **Additional resources:** Link to studies, expert statements, or institutional reports for readers who want deeper evidence.
    

### Signs the Transcript Is Insufficient

- Myths are only mentioned in passing without clear statements of what people believe.
    
- There is little or no presentation of factual evidence; statements are made without supporting data or references.
    
- The explanation does not address why the misconception exists or fails to clarify the error.
    
- The transcript dwells on repeating the myth but never reinforces the correct information, risking the “familiarity effect.”
    
- Lacks consideration of audience perspective or fails to acknowledge why the myth persists.
    

### Editorial Flexibility Notes

- Writers can choose different structures (e.g., one myth per section or grouping similar myths together), but each myth should follow the fact–myth–fallacy–fact sequence for clarity.
    
- Tone should be authoritative yet empathetic; avoid condescension that might alienate readers who hold the misconception.
    
- Use storytelling or analogies to engage readers, but ensure narratives serve the purpose of explaining the fallacy rather than distracting from it.
    
## General Notes 

- **Reader focus:** Regardless of article type, content must be tailored to the target audience’s knowledge level and interests. Avoid jargon, or define it when unavoidable.
    
- **Evidence and citations:** Whenever factual claims are made, they should be supported by credible sources. Linking to primary studies, reputable news sites or official documents enhances trust.
    
- **Narrative flow:** Each article should have a clear beginning, middle and end. Even FAQ and pros/cons lists benefit from short introductions and conclusions to frame the content.
    
- **Avoid redundancy:** Ensure that points are not repeated without adding new information. Repetition can indicate that the transcript lacks sufficient detail and may need enrichment.
    

These guidelines provide qualitative standards rather than rigid templates, enabling writers and AI systems to craft varied yet high‑quality articles across different formats. Use them to assess whether a transcript contains the necessary material or requires supplementation through research or additional context.
