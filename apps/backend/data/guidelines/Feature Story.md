## Feature Story Guide

### Purpose & Reader Intent

A feature story tells a **compelling narrative** about people, trends or issues. Readers seek **human‑focused storytelling** that goes beyond straight facts to explore motivations, emotions and broader significance. These pieces often illuminate larger trends through the lens of a single individual or anecdote and are not constrained by breaking‑news urgency.

### Core Content Expectations

- **Narrative Arc.** A feature should have a clear beginning, middle and end. It often opens with a vivid anecdote, sets up a tension or theme, explores the issue through scenes and characters, and concludes with resolution or reflection.
    
- **Character and Scene Details.** Rich descriptions of people, settings and actions bring the story to life. Dialogue and sensory details help readers connect emotionally.
    
- **Nut Graf and Context.** After the opening scene, a concise nut graf should explain the story's relevance and connect the anecdote to a broader issue or trend.
    
- **Supporting Sections.** Subsequent sections provide analysis, data and expert commentary that deepen understanding. The "kebab" or "circle" structure is common: start with an anecdote, present the nut graf, then explore different aspects of the issue (the "meat") and end with a closing anecdote. Alternative structures include the "accordion," which zooms in and out between a central character's experiences and big‑picture context, and the "pyramid," which builds to the most compelling information.
    
- **Multiple Perspectives.** Quotes from various sources (experts, affected individuals) enrich the story and provide balance.
    
- **Strong Ending.** End with an image, quote or observation that resonates and ties back to the opening.


### Optional Enhancing Elements

- **Data visualizations or research findings** that support the theme.
    
- **Historical background** to show how the issue evolved.
    
- **Sidebars or profiles** of additional characters.
    
- **Multimedia**, such as photos or audio snippets, to immerse readers.
    
- **Foreshadowing or literary techniques** to heighten narrative tension.


### Signs the Transcript Is Insufficient

- Lacks a **central character or anecdote**; only general statements are present.
    
- Minimal descriptive details; no sense of place or personality.
    
- Missing a clear nut graf or explanation of why the subject matters.
    
- No quotes from sources; narrative feels flat or unsupported.
    
- The transcript is purely informational (e.g., a lecture) without narrative elements.


### Editorial Flexibility Notes

Feature stories allow significant creative freedom. Writers may choose among various structures (kebab, accordion, pyramid, etc.) to suit the material. Language can be more descriptive and literary than in straight news. The tone may range from contemplative to humorous depending on the subject. However, accuracy and fairness are paramount; creative flourishes should not distort facts. Because features are narrative‑driven, pacing and rhythm can vary — avoid imposing a rigid template.
