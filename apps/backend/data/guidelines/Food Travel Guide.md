## Food Travel Guide

### Purpose & Reader Intent

A food travel guide exists to transport readers into the culinary heart of a destination. Readers expect more than a list of dishes; they want to understand the flavors, ingredients and stories behind local cuisine. A strong food guide inspires culinary exploration, suggests where to eat, and explains cultural context. The article should serve as both an armchair journey and a practical resource for those planning to taste the destination themselves.

### Core Content Expectations

- **Culinary overview and local dishes:** Describe the destination's iconic dishes, snacks, drinks and desserts. Include ingredients, flavor profiles and why locals love them. Provide cultural or historical context for each item. Research and firsthand knowledge are essential; writers should be "knowledgeable about [their] subject in advance" and cross‑check facts.
    
- **Places to experience the food:** Offer specific recommendations on where to try these foods—markets, street stalls, restaurants, cafés, cooking classes or home‑stays. Include names, approximate locations/neighborhoods and notable ambiance. Practical detail allows readers to replicate the experience and differentiates the guide from generic lists.
    
- **Sensory and narrative detail:** Use vivid sensory descriptions (taste, smell, texture, atmosphere) drawn from firsthand experiences. Avoid clichés; unique descriptions and personal observations convey authenticity. Narrate the journey (how you discovered a dish, interactions with vendors) to connect readers emotionally.
    
- **Cultural and etiquette context:** Explain what the food reveals about local culture, history, geography and seasons. Mention dining customs, ordering etiquette or social norms. Respect cultural context and avoid stereotypes; writers should "respect the cultural context of the foods … and spend enough time" to learn about people and food sources.
    
- **Practical guidance:** Provide essential logistics—typical prices, best times to visit markets or restaurants, reservation tips, transportation, and any required health or dietary considerations. Practical information makes the piece useful and trustworthy.
    

### Optional Enhancing Elements

- **Local voices and stories:** Include quotes or interviews with chefs, market vendors or residents. Local perspectives add authenticity and prevent an outsider‑only view.
    
- **Culinary history or ingredients:** Brief background on the origin of dishes, regional agriculture or unique ingredients enriches the narrative.
    
- **Comparisons and variations:** Note variations of a dish across neighborhoods or regions, or recommend similar dishes to try.
    
- **Cooking experiences:** Describe food tours, cooking classes or home‑cooking invitations that allow deeper engagement with local cuisine.
    
- **Sustainability and ethics:** Address responsible tourism by suggesting eco‑friendly eateries, fair‑trade markets or cultural sensitivity (e.g., proper tipping, respectful photography).
    

### Signs the Transcript Is Insufficient

- Only a list of dishes or restaurants without descriptive context or narrative—readers need more than names and must know why each dish matters.
    
- Lack of sensory detail; if the transcript never describes flavors, textures, aromas or ambiance, the article will feel flat.
    
- Missing cultural or historical context; without explaining why the food is important locally, the guide becomes superficial.
    
- No practical information (locations, costs, times) or only vague references; insufficient to help readers plan their own experience.
    
- Overuse of travel clichés (e.g., "mouth‑watering", "hidden gem") without unique descriptions.
    
- Transcript is repetitive or filler (e.g., long asides unrelated to food) that do not advance the culinary narrative.
    

### Editorial Flexibility Notes

- Writers have freedom in structure—chronological journey, thematic sections (street food, fine dining), or focusing on a single dish's story. The article should not follow a rigid template but must still cover the core content.
    
- Tone can range from personal memoir to objective guide; it should be engaging and accurate. Avoid listicles that feel promotional or formulaic.
    
- Creativity in narrative openings (anecdote, sensory hook, cultural observation) is encouraged, provided the piece remains informative and respectful.
    
- While personal experiences add authenticity, be mindful of cultural appropriation; include local voices and perspectives and prioritize cultural respect.
