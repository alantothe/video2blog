### Purpose & Reader Intent

A buyer’s guide helps readers understand **what matters when choosing between products or services**. It should **educate and empower** prospects who are close to making a purchase decision by explaining the problems they face, the criteria that matter and the trade‑offs involved. A good guide speaks to bottom‑of‑funnel readers and balances education with conversion by acting as an agnostic advisor: it offers neutral guidance even if the criteria align with the publisher’s strengths.

### Core Content Expectations

1. **Executive summary:** Early in the piece, set expectations by explaining who the guide is for, what decision it supports, and what the reader will learn. This summary should orient readers who skim or share the article.
    
2. **Problem definition:** Clearly articulate the challenge the reader is trying to solve and why it’s difficult. Ground the discussion in real operational friction or evolving market trends rather than manufactured pain points.
    
3. **What to look for:** Lay out the key evaluation criteria—capabilities, compatibility, support models or service expectations—so readers know what to compare. The tone should remain consultative and neutral even if the criteria align with a particular product’s strengths.
    
4. **Decision criteria and trade‑offs:** Help readers think like stakeholders by weighing competing priorities (e.g., cost versus long‑term scalability). This section shows that you understand the complexity of real‑world decisions.
    
5. **Stakeholder alignment:** Identify the roles typically involved in the decision—IT, procurement, line‑of‑business leaders, compliance—and note what each cares about. Provide language or arguments that help readers secure internal buy‑in.
    
6. **Evaluation timeline and triggers:** Describe when buyers should start looking, what a typical decision process involves and how long it takes from shortlisting to onboarding. A sample timeline helps make the process feel manageable.
    
7. **Optional product‑specific guidance:** If the guide targets late‑stage prospects, include a section that maps a particular product to the criteria just outlined. Use tables, checklists or feature matrices to connect the dots and keep it consultative rather than salesy.
    
8. **Proof points:** Provide brief proof—customer stats, mini case studies or outcome summaries—to show the product or solution works in the real world. Each proof point should tie back to a decision factor.
    
9. **What happens after purchase:** Outline onboarding, implementation, success metrics and support so readers can picture the post‑purchase experience and feel reassured.
    

### Optional Enhancing Elements

- **Market and trend context:** Briefly describe industry trends or recent innovations that shape buyer expectations.
    
- **Glossaries, templates or sidebars:** Supplemental tools (like checklists or glossaries) can sit in sidebars or appendices to keep the main narrative lean.
    
- **Comparisons or competitor snapshots:** Short comparisons to alternative solutions or approaches can increase trust as long as they remain neutral.
    

### Signs the Transcript Is Insufficient

- The transcript only lists product features without explaining **why those features matter** or how to evaluate them.
    
- No clear problem definition or context is provided; readers wouldn’t know whether the guide addresses their needs.
    
- Key decision criteria, trade‑offs, stakeholder considerations or timelines are missing entirely.
    
- The tone is promotional rather than agnostic, making it a brochure rather than a guide.
    
- There are no examples, proof points or post‑purchase considerations to reassure the reader.
    

### Editorial Flexibility Notes

Writers don’t need to rigidly follow the exact order of the sections above. They can combine or expand sections depending on the complexity of the category or the audience’s sophistication. A buyer’s guide can be **agnostic** or **product‑specific**. Tone may vary from formal to conversational, but the narrative must always be **educational, neutral and helpful**. Long guides should be broken up with design elements, sidebars or linked companion pieces. Creativity in presentation is welcome as long as the essential questions are answered.

## General Notes 

- **Reader focus:** Regardless of article type, content must be tailored to the target audience’s knowledge level and interests. Avoid jargon, or define it when unavoidable.
    
- **Evidence and citations:** Whenever factual claims are made, they should be supported by credible sources. Linking to primary studies, reputable news sites or official documents enhances trust.
    
- **Narrative flow:** Each article should have a clear beginning, middle and end. Even FAQ and pros/cons lists benefit from short introductions and conclusions to frame the content.
    
- **Avoid redundancy:** Ensure that points are not repeated without adding new information. Repetition can indicate that the transcript lacks sufficient detail and may need enrichment.
    

These guidelines provide qualitative standards rather than rigid templates, enabling writers and AI systems to craft varied yet high‑quality articles across different formats. Use them to assess whether a transcript contains the necessary material or requires supplementation through research or additional context.
