## FAQ Article Guide

### Purpose & Reader Intent

A FAQ article compiles short, direct answers to common questions about a single topic. It exists to offer quick, accessible explanations for issues that don’t warrant standalone articles but are significant for user understanding. According to Mozilla’s contributor guidelines, FAQ articles address recurring inquiries and aim to provide users with concise information in one convenient location.

### Core Content Expectations

- **List of relevant questions:** Identify the most frequently asked questions through user feedback, support tickets or community forums.
    
- **Concise answers:** Provide clear, to‑the‑point responses. If a question requires extensive detail, link to a more comprehensive resource instead of overloading the answer.
    
- **Logical organization:** Arrange questions in a sequence that makes sense—group by theme or move from general to specific.
    
- **Descriptive headings:** Use the questions themselves as section headings (usually H2). This helps users scan and find relevant information quickly.
    
- **Links to further reading:** Where appropriate, include links to in‑depth articles, documentation or external sources for readers seeking more detail.
    

### Optional Enhancing Elements

- **Brief introduction or summary:** A short opening paragraph can define the overall topic and set expectations for the reader.
    
- **Grouping by subtopics:** For long FAQs, consider adding sub‑headers or categories to improve navigation.
    
- **Contextual notes:** Where needed, add brief contextual statements explaining why a question arises (e.g., after a software update or feature change).
    

### Signs the Transcript Is Insufficient

- Few or no questions posed; conversation lacks clear Q&A structure or repeated inquiries.
    
- Answers ramble without clear resolution or are overly technical with no simplification.
    
- The order of questions feels random, causing confusion.
    
- The transcript repeats the same question without adding new information, indicating a lack of variety in inquiries.
    
- No references to sources or further reading when the topic clearly demands more depth.
    

### Editorial Flexibility Notes

- Tone should be succinct and neutral; however, slight warmth or humor can be added if it matches the brand voice and aids readability.
    
- The number of questions can vary widely. There’s no need to force a specific count—include as many as are genuinely useful.
    
- Writers may choose to group questions by theme or chronology; both are acceptable if the logic is clear to readers


## General Notes 

- **Reader focus:** Regardless of article type, content must be tailored to the target audience’s knowledge level and interests. Avoid jargon, or define it when unavoidable.
    
- **Evidence and citations:** Whenever factual claims are made, they should be supported by credible sources. Linking to primary studies, reputable news sites or official documents enhances trust.
    
- **Narrative flow:** Each article should have a clear beginning, middle and end. Even FAQ and pros/cons lists benefit from short introductions and conclusions to frame the content.
    
- **Avoid redundancy:** Ensure that points are not repeated without adding new information. Repetition can indicate that the transcript lacks sufficient detail and may need enrichment.
    

These guidelines provide qualitative standards rather than rigid templates, enabling writers and AI systems to craft varied yet high‑quality articles across different formats. Use them to assess whether a transcript contains the necessary material or requires supplementation through research or additional context.
